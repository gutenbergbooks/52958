<h3><a name="NOTES_ON_MANUSCRIPTS_AND" id="NOTES_ON_MANUSCRIPTS_AND">NOTES ON MANUSCRIPTS AND
EDITIONS</a></h3>


<p>This English book exists in two Manuscripts: No. 30 of
the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (<i>Bibliotheca Bigotiana</i>,
388), and No. 2499 <i>Sloane</i>, in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The Paris Manuscript is of the Sixteenth Century, the Sloane
is in a Seventeenth Century handwriting; the English of the
Fourteenth Century seems to be on the whole well preserved in
both, especially perhaps in the later Manuscript, which must
have been copied from one of mixed East Anglian and northern
dialects. This manuscript has no title-page, and nothing is
known as to its history. Delisle's catalogue of the <i>Biblioth.
Bigot.</i> (1877) gives no particulars as to the acquisition of
No. 388. The two versions may be compared in these
sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>Chap. II., <i>Paris</i> MS.: "This revelation was made to a Symple
creature unlettyrde leving in deadly flesh the yer of our Lord a
thousande and thre hundered and lxxiii the xiii Daie of May."</p>

<p><i>Sloane</i>: "These Revelations were shewed to a simple creature
that cowde no letter the yeere of our Lord 1373 the xiij day
of may."</p>

<p>Chap. LI., <i>Paris</i> MS.: "The colour of his face was feyer
brown whygt with full semely countenaunce. his eyen were
blakke most feyer and semely shewyng full of lovely pytte and
within hym an heyward long and brode all full of endlesse
hevynlynes. And the lovely lokyng that he lokyd on his
servant contynually. And namely in his fallyng ÷ me thought it
myght melt oure hartys for love. and brek them on twoo for Joy."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Sloane</i>: "The color of his face was faire browne, with ful
semely features, his eyen were blak most faire and semely
shewand ful of lovely pety and within him an heyward long and
brode all full of endles hevyns, and the lovely lokeing that he
loked upon his servant continuly and namely in his fallyng me
thowte it myte molten our herts for love &amp; bresten hem on to
for joy."</p>

<p>The Sloane MS. does not mention the writer of the book,
but the copyist of the Paris version has, after the <i>Deo Gratias</i>
with which it ends, added or transcribed these words: <i>Explicit
liber Revelationem Julyane anatorite</i> [sic] <i>Norwyche cujus anime
propicietur Deus</i>.</p>

<p>Blomefield, in his <i>History of Norfolk</i> (iv. p. 81), speaks
of "an old vellum Manuscript, 36 pages of which contained
an account of the visions, etc.," of the Lady Julian, anchoress at
St. Julian's, Norwich, and quotes the title written by a contemporary:
"Here es a Vision shewed by the godenes of God to
a devoute Woman: and her name is Julian, that is recluse at
Noryche, and yett is on life, Anno Domini mccccxlii. In
the whilke Vision er fulle many comfortabyll words, and greatly
styrrande to alle they that desyres to be Crystes Looverse"&mdash;greatly
stirring to all that desire to be lovers of Christ. This
Manuscript, possibly containing the writing of Julian herself,
was in the possession of the Rev. Francis Peck (1692-1743).
The original MSS. of that antiquarian writer went to Sir
Thomas Cave, and ultimately to the British Museum, but his
general library was sold in 1758 to Mr T. Payne (of Payne &amp;
Foss), bookseller, Strand, and this old Manuscript of the
"Revelations," which has been sought for in vain in the catalogues
of public collections, may perhaps have been bought and
sold by him.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It may be extant in some private library.</p>

<p>Tersteegen, who, in his <i>Auserlesene Beschreibungen Heiliger
Seelen</i>, gives a long extract from Julian's book (vol. iii. p. 252,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
3rd ed. 1784), mentions in his preface that he had seen "in
the Library of the late Poiret" an old Manuscript of these
Revelations. Pierre Poiret, author of several works on mystical
theology, died in 1719 near Leyden, but the Manuscript
has not found its way to the University there.</p>

<p>Poiret himself refers thus to Julian and her book in his
<i>Catalogus Auctorum Mysticorum</i>, giving to her name the asterisk
denoting greatness: "<i>Julianae Matris Anachoretae, Revelationes
de Amore Dei. Anglice. Theodidactae, profundae, ecstaticae.</i>"
(<i>Theologiae Pacificae itemque Mysticae</i>, p. 336. Amsterdam,
1702.)</p>

<p>The earliest printed edition of Julian's book was prepared by
the Benedictine Serenus de Cressy, and published in 1670 by
permission of his ecclesiastical Superior, the Abbot of Lambspring,
under the title of <i>Sixteen Revelations of Divine
Love</i>. It agrees with the Manuscript now in Paris, but the
readings that differ from the Sloane Manuscript are very few
and are quite unimportant. This version of de Cressy's is in
Seventeenth Century English with some archaic words, which
are explained on the side margins; it was re-printed in 1843.
A modernised version taken from the Sloane MS. was published,
with a preface, by Henry Collins in 1877 (T. Richardson &amp;
Sons).</p>

<p>These three, the only printed editions, are now all of great
rarity.</p>

<p>For the following version, the editor having transcribed the
Sloane MS., divided its continuous lines into paragraphs,
supplied to many words capital letters, and while following as
far as possible the significance of the commas and occasional full
stops of the original, endeavoured to make the meaning clearer
by a more varied punctuation. As the book is designed for
general use, modern spelling has been adopted, and most words
entirely obsolete in speech have been rendered in modern
English, though a few that seemed of special significance or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
charm have been retained. Archaic forms of construction have
been almost invariably left as they are, without regard to modern
grammatical usage. Occasionally a word has been underlined
for the sake of clearness or as a help in preserving the measure
of the original language, which in a modern version must lose a
little in rhythm, by altered pronunciation and by the dropping of
the termination "en" from verbs in the infinitive. Here and
there a clause has been put within parentheses. The very few
changes made in words that might have any bearing on theological
or philosophical questions, any historical or personal
significance in the presentment of Julian's view, are noted on the
margin and in the Glossary. Where prepositions are used in a
sense now obscure they have generally been left as they are
(<i>e.g., of</i> for <i>by</i> or <i>with</i>), or have been added to rather than
altered (<i>e.g., for</i> is rendered by the archaic but intelligible <i>for
that</i>, rather than by <i>because</i>, and <i>of</i> is amplified by words in
square brackets, as [<i>by virtue</i>] <i>of</i>, [<i>out</i>] <i>of</i> rather than changed
into <i>through</i> or <i>from</i>). The editor has desired to follow the
rule of never omitting a word from the Manuscript, and of
enclosing within square brackets the very few words added. It
may be seen that these words do not alter the sense of the
passage, but are interpolated with a view to bringing it out more
clearly, in insignificant references (<i>e.g.</i> "in this [Shewing]"),
and once or twice in a passage of special obscurity (see
chap. <a href="#CHAPTER_XLV">xlv.</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="NOTE_AS_TO_THE_LADY_JULIAN_ANCHORESS" id="NOTE_AS_TO_THE_LADY_JULIAN_ANCHORESS">NOTE AS TO THE LADY JULIAN, ANCHORESS
AT ST JULIAN'S, AND THE LADY JULIAN
LAMPET, ANCHORESS AT CARROW</a></h3>


<p>In <i>Carrow Abbey</i>, by Walter Rye (privately printed,
1889), is given a list of Wills, in which the name of the
Lady Julian Lampet frequently occurs as a legatee between the
years 1427 (Will of Sir John Erpingham) and 1478 (Will of
William Hallys). Comparing the Will of Hallys with that of
Margaret Purdance, which was made in 1471 but not proved till
1483, and from which the name of Lady Julian Lampet as a
legatee is stroked out, no doubt because of her death, we find
evidence that this anchoress died between 1478 and 1483. As
even the earlier of these dates was a hundred and thirty-six years
after the birth of the writer of the "Revelations," who in May
1373 was over thirty years of age, the identity of the "Lady
Julian, recluse at Norwich," with the Lady Julian Lampet,
though it has naturally been suggested, is surely an impossibility.
There were anchorages in the churchyards both of St Julian's,
Conisford (which belonged to the nuns of Carrow in the sense
of its revenues having been made over to them by King Stephen
for the support of that Priory or "Abbey"), and of St Mary's,
the Convent Church of the nuns. See the Will of Robert Pert&mdash;proved
1445&mdash;which left "to the anchoress of Carhowe 1s.,
to ditto at St Julian's 1s.," and that of the Lady Isobel Morley,
who in 1466 left bequests to "Dame Julian, anchoress at Carrow,
and Dame Agnes, anchoress at St Julian's in Cunisford"&mdash;no
doubt the same Dame Agnes that is mentioned by Blomefield
as being at St Julian's in 1472. This Agnes may have been
the immediate successor of Julian the writer of the "Revelations,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
who is spoken of as "yet in life"&mdash;as if in great age&mdash;in
1442, when she would be a hundred years old.</p>

<p>Perhaps the almost invariable use of the surname of the Carrow
Dame Julian (who was, no doubt, of the family of Sir Ralph
Lampet&mdash;frequently mentioned by Blomefield and in the <i>Paston
Letters</i>) may go to establish proof that there had been before
her and in her earlier years of recluse life another anchoress
Julian, who most likely had been educated at Carrow, but who
lived as an anchoress at St Julian's, and was known simply as
Dame or "the Lady" Julian.</p>

<p>From Blomefield's <i>History of Norfolk</i>, vol. iv. p. 524:
"Carhoe or Carrow stands on a hill by the side of the river,
about a furlong from Conisford or Southgates, and was always
in the liberty of the City [of Norwich].... Here was an
ancient Hospital or Nunnery, dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint
John, to which King Stephen having given lands and meadows
without the South-gate, Seyna and Lescelina, two of the sisters,
in 1146 began the foundations of a new monastery called Kairo,
Carrow, Car-hou, and sometimes Car-Dieu, which was dedicated
to the Virgin Mary and Saint John, and consisted of a prioress and
nine (afterwards twelve) Benedictine black nuns.... Their church
was founded by King Stephen and was dedicated to the Blessed
Virgin, and had a chapel of St John Baptist joined to its south
side, and another of St Catherine to its north; there was also an
anchorage by it, and in 1428 Lady Julian Lampet was anchoress
there." ... "This nunnery for many years had been a school
or place of education for the young ladies of the chief families of
the diocese, who boarded with and were educated by the nuns."</p>

<p>From Dr Jessopp's <i>Visitations of the Diocese of Norwich</i>, 1492-1532,
Introduction, p. xliv.: "The priory of Carrow had always
enjoyed a good reputation, and the house had for long been a
favourite retreat for the daughters of the Norwich citizens who
desired to give themselves to a life of religious retirement."</p>

<p>Very little is known of the outer life of the woman
that nearly five hundred years ago left us this
book.</p>

<p>It is in connection with the old Church of St Julian
in the parish of Conisford, outlying Norwich, that
Julian is mentioned in Blomefield's <i>History of Norfolk</i>
(vol. iv. p. 81): "In the east part of the churchyard
stood an anchorage in which an ankeress or recluse
dwelt till the Dissolution, when the house was demolished,
though the foundations may still be seen
(1768). In 1393 Lady Julian, the ankeress here was
a strict recluse, and had two servants to attend her in
her old age. This woman was in these days esteemed
one of the greatest holiness. In 1472 Dame Agnes
was recluse here; in 1481, Dame Elizabeth Scott;
in 1510, Lady Elizabeth; in 1524, Dame Agnes
Edrygge."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>
<p>The little Church of St Julian (in use at this day)
still keeps from Norman times its dark round tower of
flint rubble, and still there are traces about its foundation
of the anchorage built against its south-eastern
wall. "This Church was founded," says the History
of the County, "before the Conquest, and was given
to the nuns of Carhoe (Carrow) by King Stephen, their
founder; it hath a round tower and but one bell; the
north porch and nave are tiled, and the chancel is
thatched. There was an image of St Julian in a niche
of the wall of the Church, in the Churchyard." Citing
the record of a burial in "the churchyard of St Julian,
the King and Confessor," Blomefield observes: "which
shews that it was not dedicated to St Julian, the Bishop,
nor St Julian, the Virgin."</p>

<p>The only knowledge that we have directly from Julian
as to any part of her history is given in her account of
the time and manner in which the Revelation came, and
of her condition before and during and after this special
experience. She tells how on the 13th day of May,
1373,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Revelation of Love was shewed to her, "a
simple creature, unlettered," who had before this time
made certain special prayers from out of her longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
after more love to God and her trouble over the sight
of man's sin and sorrow. She had come now, she
mentions, to the age of thirty, for which she had in
one of these prayers, desired to receive a greater consecration,&mdash;thinking,
perhaps, of the year when the
Carpenter's workshop was left by the Lord for wider
ministry,&mdash;she was "thirty years old and an half."
This would make her birth-date about the end of 1342,
and the old Manuscript says that she "was yet in life"
in 1442. Julian relates that the Fifteen consecutive
"Shewings" lasted from about four o'clock till after
nine of that same morning, that they were followed by
only one other Shewing (given on the night of the next
day), but that through later years the teaching of these
Sixteen Shewings had been renewed and explained and
enlarged by the more ordinary enlightenment and influences
of "the same Spirit that shewed them." In
this connection she speaks, in different chapters, of
"fifteen years after and more," and of twenty years
after, "save three months"; thus her book cannot have
been finished before 1393.</p>

<p>Of the circumstances in which the Revelations came,
and of all matters connected with them, Julian gives a
careful account, suggestive of great calmness and power
of observation and reflection at the time, as well as
of discriminating judgment and certitude afterwards.
She describes the preliminary seven days' sickness, the
cessation of all its pain during the earlier visions, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
which she had spiritual sight of the Passion of Christ,
and indeed during all the five hours' "special Shewing";
the return of her physical pain and mental distress
and "dryness" of feeling when the vision closed;
her falling into doubt as to whether she had not simply
been delirious, her terrifying dream on the Friday night,&mdash;noting
carefully that "this horrible Shewing" came
in her sleep, "and so did none other"&mdash;none of the
Sixteen Revelations of Love came thus. Then she tells
how she was helped to overcome the dream-temptation
to despair, and how on the following night another
Revelation, conclusion and confirmation of all, was
granted to strengthen her faith. Again her faith was
assayed by a similar dream-appearance of fiends that
seemed as it were to be mocking at all religion, and
again she was delivered, overcoming by setting her eyes
on the Cross and fastening her heart on God, and comforting
her soul with speech of Christ's Passion (as she
would have comforted another in like distress) and rehearsing
the Faith of all the Church. It may be noted
here that Julian when telling how she was given grace
to awaken from the former of these troubled dreams,
says, "anon all vanished away and I was brought to
great rest and peace, without sickness of body or dread
of conscience," and that nothing in the book gives any
ground for supposing that she had less than ordinary
health during the long and peaceful life wherein God
"lengthened her patience." Rather it would seem that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
one so wholesome in mind, so happy in spirit, so wisely
moderate, no doubt, in self-guidance, must have kept
that general health that <i>she</i> could not despise who speaks
of God having "no disdain" to serve the body, for
love of the soul, of how we are "soul and body clad
in the Goodness of God," of how "God hath made
waters plenteous in earth to our service and to our
bodily ease,"<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and of how Christ waiteth to minister
to us His gifts of grace "unto the time that we be
waxen and grown, our soul with our body and our
body with our soul, either of them taking help of other,
till we be brought unto stature, as nature worketh."<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Julian mentions neither her name not her state in life;
she is "the soul," the "poor" or "simple" soul that
the Revelation was shewed to&mdash;"a simple creature," in
herself, a mere "wretch," frail and of no account.</p>

<p>Of her parentage and early home we know nothing:
but perhaps her own exquisite picture of Motherhood&mdash;of
its natural (its "kind") love and wisdom and knowledge&mdash;is
taken partly from memory, with that of the
kindly nurse, and the child, which by nature loveth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
Mother and each of the other children, and of the
training by Mother and Teacher until the child is
brought up to "the Father's bliss" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXI">lxi.-lxiii.</a>).</p>

<p>The title "Lady," "Dame" or "Madame" was commonly
accorded to anchoresses, nuns, and others that
had had education in a Convent.<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Julian, no doubt, was of gentle birth, and she would
probably be sent to the Convent of Carrow for her
education. There she would receive from the Benedictine
nuns the usual instruction in reading, writing,
Latin, French, and fine needlework, and especially in
that Common Christian Belief to which she was always
in her faithful heart and steadfast will so loyal,&mdash;"the
Common Teaching of Holy Church in which I was afore
informed and grounded, and with all my will having in
use and understanding" (<a href="#CHAPTER_XLVI">xlvi.</a>).</p>

<p>It is most likely that Julian received at Carrow the
consecration of a Benedictine nun; for it was usual,
though not necessary, for anchoresses to belong to one
or other of the Religious Orders.</p>

<p>The more or less solitary life of the anchorite or
hermit, the anchoress or recluse, had at this time, as
earlier, many followers in the country parts and large
towns of England. Few of the "reclusoria" or women's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
anchorholds were in the open country or forest-lands
like those that we come upon in Medieval romances,
but many churches of the villages and towns had
attached to them a timber or stone "cell"&mdash;a little
house of two or three rooms inhabited by a recluse
who never left it, and one servant, or two, for errands
and protection. Occasionally a little group of recluses
lived together like those three young sisters of the
Thirteenth Century for whom the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>, a Rule
or Counsel for "Ancres," was at their own request
composed. The recluse's chamber seems to have generally
had three windows: one looking into the adjoining
Church, so that she could take part in the Services
there; another communicating with one of those rooms
under the keeping of her "maidens," in which occasionally
a guest might be entertained; and a third&mdash;the
"parlour" window&mdash;opening to the outside, to which
all might come that desired to speak with her. According
to the <i>Ancren Riwle</i> the covering-screen for this
audience-window was a curtain of double cloth, black
with a cross of white through which the sunshine would
penetrate&mdash;sign of the Dayspring from on high. This
screen could of course be drawn back when the recluse
'held a parliament' with any that came to her.<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>
<p>Before Julian passed from the sunny lawns and
meadows of Carrow, along the road by the river and
up the lane to the left by the gardens and orchards of
the Coniston of that day, to the little Churchyard
house that would hide so much from her eyes of outward
beauty, and yet leave so much in its changeful
perpetual quietude around her (great skies overhead
like the ample heavenly garments of her vision "blue
as azure most deep and fair"; little Speedwell's blue by
the crannied wall of the Churchyard&mdash;<i>Veronika</i>, true
Image, like the Saint's "Holy Vernacle at Rome") her
vow<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> might be: "I offering yield myself to the divine
Goodness<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for service, in the order of anchorites: and I
promise to continue in the service of God after the rule of
that order, by divine grace and the counsel of the Church:
and to shew canonical obedience to my ghostly fathers."</p>

<p>The only reference that Julian makes to the life
dedicated more especially to Contemplation is where
she is speaking, as if from experience, of the temptation
to despair because of falling oftentimes into the
same sins, "especially into sloth and losing of time. For
that is the beginning of sin, as to my sight,&mdash;and especially
to the creatures that have given themselves to serve our
Lord with inward beholding of His blessed Goodness."<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span></p>
<p>"<i>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I
seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the
days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire
in His temple</i>"&mdash;His Sanctuary of the Church or of the
soul. <i>That</i> was her calling. She had heard the Voice
that comes to the soul in Spring-time and calls to the
Garden of lilies, and calls to the Garden of Olive-trees
(where all the spices offered are in one Cup of Heavenly
Wine): <i>"Surge, propera amica mea: jam enim Hyems
transiit, imber ambiit et recessit. Surge, propera amica mea,
speciosa mea, et veni." "Arise: let us go hence."<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "For
this is the natural yearnings of the soul by the touching
of the Holy Ghost: God of Thy Goodness, give me Thyself,
for Thou art enough to me; ... and if I ask anything
that is less, ever me wanteth; but only in Thee I have
all"</i> (<a href="#CHAPTER_V">v.</a>).</p>

<p>"A soul that only fasteneth itself on to God with
very trust, either by seeking or in beholding, it is the
most worship that it may do to Him, as to my sight"
(<a href="#THE_SECOND_REVELATION">x.</a>). "To enquire" and "to behold"&mdash;no doubt it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
was for these that Julian sought time and quiet. For
she had urgent questionings and "stirrings" in her
mind over "the great hurt that is come by sin to the
creature"&mdash;"afore this time often I wondered why by
the great foreseeing wisdom of God the beginning of
sin was not letted" ("mourning and sorrow I made over
it without reason and discretion"); and also she was
filled with desire for God: "the longing that I had to
Him afore" (<a href="#THE_THIRTEENTH_REVELATION">xxvii.</a>).</p>

<p>Moreover, this life to which Julian gave herself was
to be a life of "meek continuant prayers" "for enabling"
of herself in her weakness, and for help to
others in all their needs. For thought and worship
could only be held together by active prayer: the
pitiful beholding of evil and pain and the joyful beholding
of Goodness and Love would be at war, as
it were, with each other, unless they were set at peace
for the time by the prayer of intercession. And <i>that</i>
is the call of the loving soul, strong in its infant
feebleness to wake the answering Revelation of Love
to faith that "all shall be well," and that "all is
well" and that when all are come up above and the
whole is known, all shall be seen to be well, and
to have been well through the time of tribulation and
travail.</p>

<p>"At some time in the day or night," says the <i>Ancren
Riwle</i>, which Julian perhaps may have read, though as
to such prayers her compassionate heart was its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
director&mdash;"At some time in the day or night think upon
and call to mind all who are sick and sorrowful,
who suffer affliction and poverty, the pain which
prisoners endure who lie heavily fettered with iron;
think especially of the Christians who are amongst the
heathen, some in prison, some in so great thralldom
as is an ox or an ass; compassionate those who are
under strong temptations; take thought of all men's
sorrows, and sigh to our Lord that He may take
care of them and have compassion and look upon them
with a gracious eye; and if you have leisure, repeat
this Psalm, <i>I have lifted up mine eyes. Paternoster. Return,
O Lord, how long, and be intreated in favour of Thy servants:
Let us pray.</i> 'Stretch forth, O Lord, to thy servants and
to thy handmaids the right hand of thy heavenly aid,
that they may seek thee with all their heart, and obtain
what they worthily ask through Jesus Christ our Lord.'"
Julian tells how in her thinking of sin and its hurt there
passed before her sight all that Christ bore for us, "and
His dying; and all the pains and passions of all His
creatures, ghostly and bodily; <i>and the beholding of this</i>&mdash;with
all pains that ever were or ever shall be" (<a href="#THE_THIRTEENTH_REVELATION">xxvii</a>).
From sin, except as a general conception, Julian's natural
instinct was to turn her eyes; but with this Christly
compassion in her heart in looking on the sorrows of the
world she could not but take account of its sin. As she
came to be convinced that "though we be highly lifted
up into contemplation, it is needful for us to see our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
sin,"&mdash;albeit we should not accuse ourselves "overdone
much" or "be heavy or sorrowful indiscreetly"&mdash;so
when sins of others were brought before her she would
seek with compassion to take the sinner's part of contrition
and prayer. "The beholding of other man's sins,
it maketh as it were a thick mist afore the eyes of the
soul, and we cannot, for the time, see the fairness of God,
but if we can behold them with contrition with him, with
compassion on him, and with holy desire to God for
him" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXVI">lxxvi.</a>).</p>

<p>And notwithstanding all the stir and eager revival
of the Fourteenth Century in religion, politics, literature
and general life, there was much both of sin and of
sorrow then to exercise the pitiful soul&mdash;troubles
enough in Norwich itself, of oppression and riot and
desolating pestilence&mdash;troubles enough in Europe, West
and East,&mdash;wars and enslaving and many cruelties in
distant lands, and harried Armenian Christians coming
to the Court of Edward to plead for succour in their
long-enduring patience. There was trouble wherever
one looked; but to prayer, and to that compassion which
is in itself a prayer, the answer came. Indeed the compassion
was its own first immediate answer: for "then
I saw that each kind compassion that man hath on his
<i>even-Cristen</i> (his fellow-Christians) with charity, <i>it is
Christ in him</i>." This is the comfort that both comforts
in waiting and calls to deeds of help. And such
"charity" of social service was not beyond the scope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
of the life "enclosed,"&mdash;whether it might be by deed
or, as more often, by speech.<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It is in her seeking for truth and her beholding of
Love that we best know Julian. Of the opening of the
Revelation she says: "In all this I was greatly stirred
in charity to mine even-Christians, that they might see
and know the same that I saw: for I would it were
comfort to them," and again and again throughout the
book she declares that the "special Shewing" is given not
for her in special, but for all&mdash;for all are meant to be
one in comfort as all are one in need. "Because of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
Shewing I am not good, but if I love God the better:
and in as much as ye love God the better it is more to
you than to me.... For we are all one in comfort.
For truly it was not shewed me that God loved me
better than the least soul that is in grace; for I am
certain that there be many that never had any Shewing
nor sight but of the common teaching of Holy Church
that love God better than I. For if I look singularly to
myself I am right nought; but in general [manner of
regarding] I am, I hope, in oneness of charity with all
mine even-Christians. For in this oneness standeth the
life of all mankind that shall be saved, and that which I
say of me, I say in the person of all mine even-Christians:
for I am taught in the Spiritual Shewing
of our Lord God that He meaneth it so. And therefore
I pray you for God's sake, and counsel you for
your own profit that ye leave the beholding of a worthless
creature [a "wretch"] it was shewed to and mightily,
wisely and meekly behold God that of His special goodness
would shew it generally, in comfort of us all" (<a href="#CHAPTER_IX">ix.</a>).</p>

<p>Thus Julian turns our eyes from looking <i>on</i> her to
looking <i>with</i> her on the Revelation of Divine Love.</p>

<p>Yet surely in her we have also "a shewing"&mdash;a
shewing of the same. She tells us little of her own
story, and little is told us of her by any one else, but
all through her recording of the Revelation the simple
creature to whom it was made unconsciously shews
herself, so that soon we come to know her with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
pleasure that surely she would not think too "special"
in its regard. (For she herself in speaking of Love
makes note that the general does not exclude the
special). Perhaps we are helped in this friendly acquaintanceship
by those endearingly characteristic little
formulas of speech disavowing any claim to dogmatic
authority in the statements of her views of truth: those
modest parentheses "as to my sight," "as to mine understanding."
"Wisdom and truth and love," the dower
that she saw in the Gracious soul, were surely in the
soul of this meek woman; but enclosing these gifts of
nature and grace are qualities special to Julian: depth of
passion, with quietness, order, and moderation; loyalty
in faith, with clearest candour&mdash;"I believe ... but this
was not shewed me"&mdash;(<a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIII">xxxiii.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXXVII">lxxvii.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXXX">lxxx.</a>) pitifulness
and sympathy, with hope and a blithe serenity; sound
good sense with a little sparkle upon it&mdash;as of delicate
humour (that crowning virtue of saints); and beneath
all, above all, an exquisite tenderness that turns her
speech to music. "<i>I will lay thy Stones with fair Colours.</i>"</p>

<p>"Thou hast the dews of thy youth." Hundreds of
years have gone since that early morning in May when
Julian thought she was dying and was "partly troubled"
for she felt she was yet in youth and would gladly have
served God more on earth with the gift of her days&mdash;hundreds
of years since the time that her heart would
fain have been told by special Shewing that "a certain
creature I loved should continue in good living"&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
still we have "mind" of her as "a gentle neighbour and
of our knowing." For those that love in simplicity are
always young; and those that have had with the larger
Vision of Love the gift of love's passionate speech, to
God or man, in word or form or deed, as treasure held&mdash;live
yet on the earth, untouched by time, though their
light is shining elsewhere for other sight.</p>

<p>"From that time that the Revelation was shewed I
desired oftentimes to learn what was our Lord's meaning.
And fifteen years afterwards and more, I was
answered in ghostly understanding, saying thus: <i>Wouldst
thou learn thy Lord's meaning in this thing? Learn it well:
Love was His meaning. Who shewed it thee? Love. What
shewed He thee? Love. Wherefore shewed it He? For
Love. Hold thee therein and thou shalt learn and know more
in the same. But thou shalt never know nor learn other thing
without end.</i>"</p>

<p>And if we, with no special shewing, might ask and,
in trust of "spiritual understanding," might answer
more&mdash;asking <i>to whom</i>, and <i>for whom</i> was the Revelation
shewed, we might answer: <i>To one that loved</i>; for all that
would learn in love.</p>

Julian. So also <i>Lady Julian Berners</i> is a name in the history of Fifteenth

<p>Without any special study of the literature of Mysticism
for purposes of comparison, in reading Julian's
book one is struck by a few characteristics wherein it differs
from many other Mystical writings as well as by qualities
that belong to most or all of that general designation.</p>

<p>The silence of this book both as to preliminary ascetic
exercises and as to ultimate visions of the Absolute,
might be attributed to Julian's being wholly concerned
with giving, for comfort to all, that special sight of
truth that came to her as the answer to her own need.
She sets out not to teach methods of any kind for the
gradual drawing near of man to God, but to record and
shew forth a Revelation, granted once, of God's actual
nearness to the soul, and for this Revelation she herself
had been prepared by the "stirring" of her conscience,
her love and her understanding, in a word of her <i>faith</i>,
even as she was in short time to be left "neither sign
nor token," but only the Revelation to hold "in faith."
Moreover, the means that in general she looks to for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
realising God's nearness, in whatever measure or manner
the revelation of it may come to any soul, is the immediate
one of faith as a gift of nature and a grace
from the Holy Ghost: faith leading by prayer, and
effort of obedience, and teachableness of spirit, into
actual experience of oneness with God. The natural
and common heritage of love and faith is a theme that is
dear to Julian: in her view, longing toward God is
grounded in the love to Him that is native to the
human heart, and this longing (painful through sin) as
it is stirred by the Holy Spirit, who comes with Christ,
is, in each naturally developed Christian, spontaneous and
increasing;&mdash;"for the nearer we be to our bliss, the
more we long after it" (<a href="#CHAPTER_XLVI">xlvi.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXXII">lxxii.</a>,<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXI"> lxxxi.</a>). "This is
the kinde [the natural] yernings of the soule by the
touching of the Holy Ghost: <i>God of Thy goodness give me
Thyself: for Thou art enow to me, and I may nothing ask
that is less that may be full worshippe to Thee</i>." God is the
first as well as the last: the soul begins as well as ends
with God: begins by Nature, begins again by Mercy,
and ends&mdash;yet "without end"&mdash;by Grace. Certainly
on the way&mdash;the way of these three, by falling, by
succour, by upraising&mdash;to the more perfect knowing of
God that is the soul's Fulfilment in Heaven, there is a
less immediate knowledge to be gained through experience:
"<i>And if I aske anything that is lesse, ever me
wantith</i>," for "It needyth us to have knoweing of the
littlehede of creatures and to nowtyn all thing that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
made, for to love and have God that is onmade." But
this knowing of the littleness of creatures comes to
Julian first of all in a sight of <i>the Goodness of God</i>; "For
[to] a soule that seith the Maker of all, all that is made
semith full litil." By the further beholding, indeed, of
God as Maker and Preserver, that which has been rightly
"noughted" as of no account, is seen to be also truly
of much account. For that which was seen by the soul
as so little that it seemed to be about to fall to nothing
for littleness, is seen by the understanding to have "three
properties":&mdash;God made it, God loveth it, God keepeth
it. Thus it is known as "great and large, fair and
good"; "it lasteth, and ever shall, for God loveth it."&mdash;Yet
again the soul breaks away to its own, with the
natural flight of a bird from its Autumn nest at the call
of an unseen Spring to the far-off land that is nearer still
than its nest, because it is in its heart. "But what is to
<i>me</i> sothly [in verity] the Maker, the Keper and the Lover,&mdash;I
cannot tell, for till I am Substantially oned [deeply
united] to Him, I may never have full rest ne very blisse;
that is to sey, that I be so festined to Him, that there is
right nowte that is made betwix my God and me" (<a href="#CHAPTER_V">v.</a>,
<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">viii.</a>). This "fastening" is all that in Julian's book represents
that needful process wherein the truth of asceticism
has a part. It is not essentially a process of detaching
the thought from created things of time&mdash;still less one
of detaching the heart from created beings of eternity&mdash;but
a process of more and more allowing and presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
the man to be fastened closely to God by means of the
original longing of the soul, the influence of the Holy
Ghost, and the discipline of life with its natural tribulations,
which by their purifying serve to strengthen the
affections that remaining pass through them. "<i>But
only in Thee I have all.</i>" On the way this discovery of
the soul at peace must needs be sometimes a word for
exclusion, in parting and pressing onward from things
that are made: in the end it is the welcome, all-inclusive.
And Julian, notwithstanding her enclosure as a recluse, is
one of those that, happy in nature and not too much
hindered by conditions of life, possess for large use <i>by
the way</i> the mystical peace of fulfilled possession through
virtue of freedom from bondage to self. For it is by
means of the tyranny of the "self," regarding chiefly
itself in its claims and enjoyments, that creature things
can be intruded between the soul and God; and always,
in some way, the meek inherit the earth. "All things
are yours; and ye are Christ's."</p>

<p>The life of a recluse demanded, no doubt, as other
lives do, a daily self-denial as well as an initiatory self-devotion,
and from Julian's silence as to "bodily exercises"
it cannot of course be assumed that she did not
give them, even beyond the incumbent rule of the
Church, though not in excess of her usual moderation,
some part in her Christian striving for mastery over self.
Nor could this silence in itself be taken as a proof that
ascetic practices had not in her view a preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
function such as has by many of the Mystics been
assigned to them during a process of self-training in
the earlier stages of the soul's ascent to aptitude for
mystical vision. It is, however, to be noted that neither
in regard to herself nor others do we hear from Julian
anything about an undertaking of this kind. To her
the "special Shewing" came as a gift, unearned, and
unexpected: it came in an abundant answer to a prayer
for other things needed by every soul.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Julian's desires
for herself were for three "wounds" to be made more
deep in her life: contrition (in sight of sin), compassion
(in sight of sorrow) and longing after God: she prayed
and sought diligently for these graces, comprehensive as
she felt they were of the Christian life and meant for all;
and with them she sought to have for herself, in particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
regard to her own difficulties, a sight of such
truth as it might "behove" her to know for the glory
of God and the comfort of men. According to Julian
the "special Shewing" is a gift of comfort for all, sent
by God in a time to some soul that is chosen in order that
it may have, and so may minister, the comfort needed by
itself and by others (<a href="#CHAPTER_IX">ix.</a>). In her experience this Revelation,
soon closed, is renewed by influence and enlightenment
in the more ordinary grace of its giver, the Holy
Ghost. But a still fuller sight of God shall be given,
she rejoices to think, in Heaven, to <i>all</i> that shall reach
that Fulfilment of blessed life&mdash;the only mount of the
soul set forth in this book. Thither, by the high-road
of Christ, all souls may go, making the steep ascent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
through "longing and desire,"&mdash;longing that embodies
itself in desire towards God, that is, in Prayer.</p>

<p>Nothing is said by Julian as to successive stages of
Prayer, though she speaks of different <i>kinds</i> of prayer as
the natural action of the soul under different experiences
or in different states of feeling or "dryness." Prayer
is <i>asking</i> ("beseeching"), with submission and acquiescence;
or <i>beholding</i>, with the <i>self</i> forgotten, yet offered-up;
it is a thanking and a praising in the heart that
sometimes breaks forth into voice; or a silent joy in the
sight of God as all-sufficient. And in all these ways
"Prayer oneth the soul to God."</p>

<p>To Julian's understanding the only Shewing of God
that could ever be, the highest and lowest, the first and
the last, was the Vision of Him as Love. "Hold thee
therin and thou shalt witten and knowen more in the
same. But thou shalt never knowen ne witten other
thing without end. Thus was I lerid that Love was
our Lord's menyng" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXVI">lxxxvi.</a>). Alien to the "simple
creature" was that desert region where some of the
lovers of God have endeavoured to find Him,&mdash;desiring
an extreme penetration of thought (human thought,
after all, since for men there is none beyond it) or an
utmost reach of worship (worship from fire and ice) in
proclaiming the Absolute One not only as All that <i>is</i>,
but as All that is <i>not</i>. Julian's desire was truly for God
in Himself, through Christ by the Holy Spirit of Love:
for God in "His homeliest home," the soul, for God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
His City. Therefore she follows only the upward way
of the light attempered by grace, not turning back to
the <i>Via Negativa</i>, that downward road that starting from
a conception of the Infinite "as the antithesis of the
finite,"<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_14" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> rather than as including and transcending the
finite, leads man to deny to his words of God all qualities
known or had by human, finite beings. Julian keeps on
the way that is natural to her spirit and to all her habits
of thought as these may have been directed by reading
and conversation: it does not take her towards that
Divine Darkness of which some seers have brought
report. Hers was not one of those souls that would,
and must, go silent and alone and strenuous through
strange places: "homely and courteous" she ever found
Almighty God in Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Julian's mystical sight was not a negation of human
modes of thought: neither was it a torture to human
powers of speech nor a death-sentence to human activities
of feeling. "He hath no despite of that which He
hath made" (<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">vi.</a>). This seer of the littleness of all
that is made saw the Divine as containing, not as
engulfing, all things that truly are, so that in some way
"all things that are made" because of His love last ever.
Certainly she passes sometimes beyond the language of
earth, seeing a love and a Goodness "more than tongue
can tell," but she is never inarticulate in any painful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
struggling way&mdash;when words are not to be found that
can tell all the truth revealed, she leaves her Lord's
"meaning" to be taken directly from Him by the
understanding of each desirous soul. So is it with the
Shewing of God as the Goodness of everything that is
good: "It is I&mdash;it is I" (<a href="#THE_TWELFTH_REVELATION">xxvi.</a>). Certainly Julian
looks both downward and upward, sees Love in the
lowest depth, far below sin, below even Mercy; sees
Love as the highest that can be, rising higher and higher
far above sight, in skies that as yet she is not called to
enter: "abysses" there are, below and above, like
Angela di Foligno's "double abyss"; but here is no
desert region like that where Angela seems as "an
eagle descending"<a name="FNanchor_3_15" id="FNanchor_3_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_15" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> from heights of unbreathable air,
baffled and blinded in its assault on the Sun, proclaiming
the Light Unspeakable in anguished, hoarse, inarticulate
cries; here is a mountain-path between the abysses
and the sound as of a chorus from pilgrims singing:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Praise to the Holiest in the height<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And in the depth be praise";&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="smcap">'All is well: All is well: All shall be well.'</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, Julian while guided by Reason is <i>led</i> by the
"Mind" of her soul&mdash;pioneer of the path through the
wood of darkness though Reason is ready to disentangle
the lower hindrances of the way; and where her instructed
soul "finds rest," those things that are hid from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
the wisdom and prudence of Reason only are to its
simplicity of obedience revealed. Even as her Way is
Christ-Jesus, and her walk by "longing and desire" is
of faith and effort, so the End and the Rest that she
seeks is the <i>fulness</i> of God, in measure as the soul can
enter upon His fulness here and in that heavenly "oneing"
with Him which shall be by grace the "fulfilling" and
"overpassing" of "Mankind." "The Mid-Person willed
to be Ground and Head of this fair End," "out of
Whom we ben al cum, in Whom we be all inclosid, into
Whom we shall all wyndyn, in Him fynding our full
Hevyn in everlestand joye" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LIII">liii.</a>).<a name="FNanchor_4_16" id="FNanchor_4_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_16" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The soul that
participates in God cannot be lost in God, the soul that
wends into oneness with God finds there at last its Self.
Words of the Spirit-nature fail to describe to man, as he
is, this fulness of personal life, and Julian falls back in
one effort, daring in its infantine concreteness of language,
on acts of all the five senses to symbolise the perfection
of spiritual life that is in oneness with God (<a href="#CHAPTER_XLIII">xliii.</a>).</p>

<p>It may be noted that in these "Revelations" there is
absolutely no regarding of Christ as the "Bridegroom"
of the individual soul: once or twice Julian in passing
uses the symbol of "the Spouse," "the Fair Maiden,"
"His loved Wife," but this she applies only to the
Church. In her usual speech Christ when unnamed is our
"Good" or our "Courteous" Lord, or sometimes simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
"God," and when she seeks to express pictorially His
union with men and His work for men, then the soul is
the Child and Christ is the Mother. In this symbolic
language the love of the Christian soul is the love of the
Child to its Mother and to each of the other children.</p>

<p>Julian's Mystical views seem in parts to be cognate
with those of earlier and later systems based on Plato's
philosophy, and especially perhaps on his doctrine of
Love as reaching through the beauties of created things
higher and higher to union with the Absolute Beauty
above, Which is God&mdash;schemes of thought developed
before her and in her time by Plotinus, Clement,
Augustine, Dionysius "the Areopagite," John the Scot,
Eckhart, the Victorines,<a name="FNanchor_5_17" id="FNanchor_5_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_17" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Ruysbroeck, and others.
One does not know what her reading may have been,
or with what people she may have conversed. Possibly
the learned Austin Friars that were settled close to
St Julian's in Conisford may have lent her books by some
of these writers, or she may have been influenced
through talks with a Confessor, or with some of the
Flemish weavers of Norwich, with whom Mystical views
were not uncommon. Yet the Mysticism of the "Revelations"
is peculiarly of the English type. Less exuberant
in language than Richard Rolle, the Hermit of Hampole,
Julian resembles him a little in her blending of practical
sense with devotional fervour; but the writer to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
she seems, at any rate in some of her phrases, most
akin is Walter Hilton, her contemporary.<a name="FNanchor_6_18" id="FNanchor_6_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_18" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Hilton, however,
is very rich in quotations from the Bible, while
Julian's only direct quotations from any book&mdash;beyond
her reference to the legend of St Dionysius&mdash;are one
that belongs to Christ: "I thirst" (<a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">xvii.</a>), and two
that belong to the soul: "Lord, save me: I perish!"
"Nothing shal depart me from the charite of Criste"
(<a href="#THE_SEVENTH_REVELATION">xv.</a>). (And indeed these three are a fit embodiment
of the Christian Faith as seen in her "Revelations.")
But Julian, while perhaps more speculative than either
of these typical English Mystics, is thoroughly a woman.
Lacking their literary method of procedure, she has a
high and tender beauty of thought and a delicate bloom
of expression that are her own rare gifts&mdash;the beauty
of the hills against skies in summer evenings, of an
orchard in mornings of April. Again and again she
stirs in the reader a kind of surprised gladness of the
simple perfection wherewith she utters, by few and
adequate words, a thought that in its quietness convinces
of truth, or an emotion deep in life. Of a little
child it has been said: "He thought great thoughts
simply," and Julian's deepness of insight and simplicity
of speech are like the Child's.<a name="FNanchor_7_19" id="FNanchor_7_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_19" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "For ere that He made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
us He loved us, and when we were made we loved
Him" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LIII">liii.</a>). "I love thee, and thou lovest me, and our
love shall not be disparted in two" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXII">lxxxii.</a>). "<i>Thou
art my Heaven.</i>" "I had liefer have been in that pain
till Doomsday than have come to Heaven otherwise
than by Him." "Human is the vehemence," says a
writer on Julian's "Revelations," of that reiterated exclusion
of all other paths to joy. 'Me liked,' she
says, 'none other heaven.' Once again she touches
the same octave, condensing in a single phrase which
has seldom been transcended in its brief expression of
the possession that leaves the infinity of love's desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
still unsatiated: '<i>I saw Him and sought Him, I had Him,
and I wanted Him.</i>' Fletcher's tenderness, Ford's passion
lose colour placed side by side with the utterances of
this worn recluse whose hands are empty of every
treasure."<a name="FNanchor_8_20" id="FNanchor_8_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_20" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Sometimes with her subject her language
assumes a majestic solemnity: "The pillars of Heaven
shall tremble and quake" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXV">lxxv.</a>); sometimes it seems
to march to its goal in an ascent of triumphal measure
as with beating of drums: "The body was in the
grave till Easter-morrow and from that time He lay
nevermore. For then was rightfully ended" ... (close
of Chap.<a href="#CHAPTER_LI"> li.</a>). Generally, perhaps, the style in its movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
recalls the rippling yet even flow of a brook,
cheerfully, sweetly monotonous: "If any such lover
be in earth which is continually kept from falling, I
know it not: for it was not shewed me. But this was
shewed: that in falling and in rising we are ever
preciously kept in one love" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXII">lxxxii.</a>). But now
and again the listener seems to be caught up to Heaven
with song, as in that time when her "marvelling" joy
in beholding love "breaks out with voice":&mdash;"Behold
and see! the precious plenty of His dearworthy blood
descended down into Hell, and braste her bands, and
delivered all that were there that belonged to the Court
of Heaven. The precious plenty of His dearworthy
blood overfloweth all Earth and is ready to wash all
creatures of sin which be of goodwill, <i>have</i> been and
<i>shall</i> be. The precious plenty of His dearworthy blood
ascended up into Heaven to the blessed body of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and there is in Him, bleeding and
praying for us to the Father, and is and shall be as
long as it needeth; and ever shall be as long as it
needeth; and evermore it floweth in all Heavens, enjoying
the salvation of all mankind that <i>are</i> there, and
<i>shall</i> be&mdash;fulfilling the Number that faileth" (<a href="#THE_FOURTH_REVELATION">xii.</a>).</p>

<p>The Early English Mystics make good reading,&mdash;even
as to the mere manner of their writings we might
say, if it were possible to separate the style from the
freshness of feeling and the pointedness of thought that
inform it; and though we do not, of course, have from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
Julian,&mdash;a woman writing of the <i>Revelations of Love</i>,&mdash;the
delightfully trenchant, easy address of Hilton in his
counsels as to how to scale the <i>Ladder of Perfection</i>&mdash;counsels
both wise and witty&mdash;yet Julian, too, with all
her sweetness, is full of this every day vigour and common
sense. And sometimes she puts things in a naïve,
engaging way of her own, grave and yet light&mdash;as if
with a little understanding smile to those to whom she
is speaking:&mdash;"Then ween we, who <i>be</i> not all wise";
"That the outward part should draw the inward to assent
<i>was not shewed to me</i>, but that the inward draweth the
outward by grace and both shall be oned in bliss without
end by the virtue of Christ, <i>this</i> was shewed" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXI">lxi.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">xix.</a>).</p>

<p>Rolle, Hilton, and more especially the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>,
give examples of that custom of allegorical interpretation
of Sacred Scriptures that has fascinated many mystical
authors, but one can scarcely suppose that this method
would ever have been a favourite one with Julian even if
she had been in the way of dealing with literary parallels
and references. For though she uses "examples," or
illustrations (sometimes calling them "shewings," or
"bodily examples") and also metaphorically figurative
speech, she does not shew any interest in elaborate,
arbitrary symbolism. At any rate she is too directly
simple, it seems, and too much in the centre of realities,
to be a writer that (without constraint of following the
lines of others) would take as foundation for an argument
or an exposition outward resemblances or verbal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
connections, fit perhaps to illustrate or enforce the truth
in question, but lacking in relation to it that inward
vital oneness whereby certain things that to man seem
below him may become symbolic to him of others that
he beholds as within or above him.</p>

<p>Exposition by analysis has been reckoned to be characteristic
of the Schoolmen rather than of the Mystics,<a name="FNanchor_9_21" id="FNanchor_9_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_21" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
though surely a mystical sight may be served by an
analytical process, and to see God in a part before or
while He is seen in the whole is effected not without
analysis of the subtlest kind. So we find analysis in
Julian's sight (<a href="#THE_THIRD_REVELATION">Rev. iii.</a>): "<i>I saw God in a point</i>"; and
in her conclusions from this: "<i>By which sight I saw
that He is in all things</i>"; and in her immediate raising,
from this conclusion, of the question: "<i>What is sin?</i>"
and throughout her treatment of the problem in the
scheme of her book. Even for the merely formal task
of distinguishing by number, Julian, we see, will set
briskly forward (though we may not feel much inclined
to follow) and often she begins her careful dissections
with: "In this I see"&mdash;four, five, or six things, as the
case may be. Her speech of spiritual Revelations is,
however, helped out less by numbers than by living
and homely things of sight: the mother and the children
and the nurse; lords and servants, kings and their
subjects (with echoes of the language of Court and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
chivalry); the deep sea-ground, waters for our service;
clothing, in its warmth, grace and colour; the light that
stands in the night, the hazel-nut, the scales of herrings.<a name="FNanchor_10_22" id="FNanchor_10_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_22" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>As one grows familiar with the "Revelations" one finds
oneself in the midst of a great scheme: a network of
ideas that cross and re-cross each other in a way not
very clear at first, perhaps, but not really in confusion.
All through this treatise from its beginning, the Revelation
as a whole is in the mind of Julian; interpolation by
another writer is out of the question: the book is all of
a piece, both as the expression of one person, in mind
and character, and as the setting forth of a theological
system. From the first we find Julian holding her
diverse threads of nature and mercy and grace for the
fabric of love she is weaving, and all through she guides
them in and out, with no hesitation, till at last the whole
design lies fair before her, shewing the <i>Goodness of God</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to this scheme it may be noted that apart
from her merely intellectual pleasure in arithmetical
methods of statement, Julian shews throughout a
mystical sense of numerical correspondences. Life,
both as being and action, is, to her sight, in its perfection
full of <i>trinities</i>; while there are <i>doubles</i>,&mdash;incident
to its imperfection, as we may put it, perhaps,
though the book itself does not mark this distinction in
so many words&mdash;there are doubles wherein two things
are partially opposed and require for their reconciling a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
third that will complete them into trinity. First, as the
Centre of all, there is the BLESSED TRINITY:
All-Might, All-Wisdom, All-Love: one Goodness:
FATHER and SON and HOLY GHOST: one Truth.
To the First, Second, and Third Persons correspond the
verbs MAY, for all-powerful freedom to do; CAN, for
all-skilful ability to do; WILL, for all-loving will to
do. So also "the Father <i>willeth</i>, the Son <i>worketh</i>, the
Holy Ghost <i>confirmeth</i>." Another nomenclature of the
Holy Trinity is, Might, Wisdom, Goodness: one Love;
but that of Might, Wisdom, Love (employed by Abelard,
Aquinas, and the Schoolmen generally) is the
usual one, while <i>Truth, Wisdom, Love,</i> is employed in
reference to that Image of God wherein Man is made:
for man has not <i>created might</i>: his might is all in the uncreated
might of God. Man in his essential Nature is
"made-trinity," "like to the unmade Blessed Trinity"&mdash;a
human trinity of truth, wisdom, love; and these
respectively <i>see, behold, and delight in</i> the Divine Trinity
of Truth, Wisdom, Love.</p>

<p>Man possesses <i>Reason,</i> which <i>knows, Mind,</i> or a feeling
wisdom, which <i>wits,</i> and <i>Love,</i> which <i>loves</i>. The
making of Man by the Son of God as Eternal Christ,
is the work of <i>Nature</i>; the falling of Man is "suffered"
(allowed), and afterwards healed, by <i>Mercy</i>; the raising
of Man to a higher than his first state is the work of
<i>Grace</i>. "In Nature we have our Being; in Mercy we
have our Increasing; in Grace we have our Fulfilling."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
The work of grace by means of our natural Reason enlightened
by the Holy Ghost to see our sins, is <i>Contrition</i>;
by means of our naturally-feeling Mind, touched
by the Holy Ghost to behold the pain of the world, is
<i>Compassion</i>; by means of our nature-and grace-inspired
Love, which loves our Maker and Saviour (still
by the separation of sin partially, painfully, hid from our
sight) is greater <i>Longing toward God</i>. This longing must
become an active "desire": for the chief work that we
can do as fellow-workers with God in achieving full
oneness with Him is <i>Prayer</i>; of which there are three
things to understand: its <i>Ground</i> is God by whose
Goodness it springeth in us; its <i>use</i> is "to turn our
will to the will of our Lord"; its <i>end</i> is "that we
should be made one with and like to our Lord in all
things." And lastly we have for this life, both by
nature and grace, the comprehensive virtue of <i>Faith</i>,
"in which all our virtues come to us" and which has in
its own nature three elements: <i>understanding, belief,</i> and
<i>trust</i>. With Faith, which belongs perhaps chiefly to
Reason,&mdash;Faith is "nought else but a right understanding,
with true belief and sure trust, of our Being:
that we are in God, and God in us, Whom we see not,"
"A light by nature coming from our endless Day, that
is our Father, God" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LIV">liv.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXIII">lxxxiii.</a>)&mdash;is also <i>Hope</i>,
which belongs to our feeling Mind (our Remembrance)
and to the work of Mercy in this our fallen state:
"Hope that we shall come to our Substance (our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
high and heavenly nature) again." Moreover, "Charity
keepeth us in Hope and Hope leadeth us in Charity;
and in the end all shall be <i>Charity</i>" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXV">lxxxv.</a>).</p>

<p>With these trinities and groups of threes are others,
belonging to God and man, mentioned successively in
the closing chapters of the book: three manners of God's
Beholding (or Regard of Countenance): that of the
Passion, that of Compassion, and that of Bliss; three
kinds of longing God has: to teach us, to have us, to
fulfil us; three things that man needs in this life from
God: Love, Longing, and Pity&mdash;"pity in love," to keep
him now, and "longing in the same love" to draw him
to heaven; three things by which man standeth in this
life and by which God is worshipped: "use of man's
reason natural; common teaching of Holy Church; inward
gracious working of the Holy Ghost";&mdash;and last
of all, "three properties of God, in which the strength
and effect of all the Revelation standeth," "<i>Life, Love
and Light</i>."</p>

<p>Again, Julian speaks of things that are <i>double</i>, and this
double state seems to be one of imperfection, though she
does not explicitly say so. Man's nature, she says, was
created "double": "<i>Substance</i>" or Spirit essential from
out of the Spirit Divine, and "<i>Sensuality</i>" or spirit related
to human senses and making human faculties, intellectual
and physical. These two, the Substance and
Sense-soul, in their imperfection of union through the
frailty of created love (which needs the divine in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
might to support it), became partially sundered by the
failing of love. "For failing of love on our part, therefore,
is all our travail"&mdash;from that comes the falling, the
dying, and the painful travail between death from sin
and life from God&mdash;both in the race and the individual.
But Christ makes the double into trinity: for Christ is
"the Mean [the medium] that keepeth the Substance
and Sense-soul together" in his Eternal, Divine-Human
Nature, because of His perfect love; and Christ-Incarnate
in His Mercy, by this same perfect love brings these two
parts anew and more closely together; and Christ uprisen,
indwelling in the soul thus united, will keep them
forever together, in oneness growing with oneness to
Him. Moreover, Man being double also as "soul and
body," needs to be "saved from double death," and this
salvation, given, is Jesus-Christ, who joined Himself to
us in the Incarnation and "yielded us up from the
Cross with His Soul and Body into His Father's hands."</p>

<p>In a mere reading of the Book these repeated correspondences
may be felt as wearisome, formal, fantastic,&mdash;or
rather they may seem so when, as here, they are
brought together and noted, for Julian herself simply
speaks of these different groups as they come in her
theme. But when one tries to follow the <i>thought</i> of this
book amongst the heights and depths of the things that
are seen and temporal and the things unseen and eternal,
these likenesses, found in all, seem to afford one guidance
and surety of footing, like steps cut out in a steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
and difficult path. And as one goes on, and the whole
of the meaning takes form, these significations of something
all-prevailing give one a partial understanding
such as Julian perhaps may have had: the feeling, the
"Mind," of a certain half-caught measure in "all things
that are," a proportion, a oneness. We are amongst
free nature's mountains, but they do not rise haphazard:
they shew a strange, a balanced beauty of line and light
and shade, as convincing, if not as clear in its intention
as the sunrise-lines and colouring of the euphrasy
flower at our feet. We hear as we walk the wandering
sound of "the vagrant, casual wind," but there is something
in its rise and fall, and rising again, that has kinship
with the flow and ebb and onrush of the lingering,
punctual waves on the shore. <i>Sursum Corda.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_13" id="Footnote_1_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_13"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The soon-forgotten petition of Julian's youth for a "bodily sickness"
does not seem to have had any connection in her mind with special
Revelation: it was desired neither as in any way a sign of invisible things
nor as a direct means of beholding them. And probably, as a matter of
fact, the sickness that was granted helped her in the way that she had
desired, helped her to the sight of the Revelation, not directly, but by
drawing her spirit to that utter dependence on and trust in God that is
death's first lesson for all, that uttermost self-devotion to God that is
life's last exercise. This spiritual state, with all that through years had
gone before of feeling and thought and life's experience, made her ready
to be shewn with special largeness and clearness God's love: how it filled
the empty place of sin and pain and sorrow with its divine fulness. As
to the "bodily sight" introducing the Revelation, a sight of "parts of the
Passion," which may be compared with "The XV. Oos"&mdash;'<i>Orationes</i>'&mdash;Passion-prayers
each beginning with '<i>O</i>' (<i>v. Hora</i> of Sarum), it was
recognised by Julian herself, even at the time of her seeing it, as being a
sight of things "not in substance or nature." In this recognition it was
proved to be neither <i>mental delusion</i> nor mere "raving" delirium. But it
would, it seems, be natural that in her weakness of body and her exaltation
of spirit (so tense that the strength of her self-surrender to death seemed
to cast her back upon bodily life in the painless world between the two)
some sort of <i>physical illusion</i> should be brought about by her prolonged
gaze upon the Face of the Crucifix, and that in her desire to enter into
the sufferings of the Passion as fully as those friends of her Lord's that
beheld it, Julian thus gazing in the midst of night's shadows and the dim
light of dawn should seem to herself to behold the sacred drops, depicted
beneath the painted or sculptured Crown of Thorns, flow down "right
plenteously." Julian gave thanks for this and all the "bodily sight"
as a gift from God. By Him sickness and illusion, as well as things evil,
are "suffered" to come, and by Him Revelation is given according to
sundry times in diverse manners. Gain of the spirit through failure of
the body&mdash;and no less by illusions of fever than by trance-state visions
their seers speak of, when Death passes the Spirit half through the gates&mdash;would
indeed be accordant with the truth of the Shewing that came to
Julian, how man is raised through shame and death into glory and life,
since in the weakness of failing men the strength of Christ is made perfect.</p></div>

1899). Some of the thoughts of children,&mdash;some of the rising
thoughts of a very little child who, like Julian, faced the darkness of
time (steadfast as Dürer's pilgrim Knight, gentle as Chaucer's,) and
beheld on his journey the shining of the Eternal City,&mdash;might be set
beside words of the Mystics as shewing, perhaps, through their very
simplicity, the oneness of truth that there is to see, and the oneness of
souls that see it. Here are convictions that the Cause of love, felt within,
"must be Jesus' Good Spirit"; comfort in discovering of death's
unreality (for if only the body, not the spirit, dies, "Oh, then it is only
<i>pretending-dying</i>!"); a flash of discernment, perhaps, as to the passing
away of lifeless evil since although, to the child, indeed "it is a pity that
some one did not come and kill the devil; and then he would be dead," yet
he has his own eschatology: "Well, when <i>we</i> are all dead, the devil
will be dead too." More significant is a sudden overawed realisation of
the great universe (setting pause to his own run round in play),
one door to a quick perception in the child's devout spirit of analogy
binding truths unseen by sense: "Is this world always going round,
<i>now</i>?" ('Yes.') "It stays still! still!&mdash;Jesus is looking down now:
we don't see Him."&mdash;Here, too, are habitual references to the things that
are <i>meant to be</i>,&mdash;musings over the goodness and knowledge, the braveness
and courtesy "meant to be" in a <i>man</i>; and here is a grateful, trusting
sense of the real 'kindness' of 'wild' creatures and of hurting
remedies. Many of those simple utterances, careless yet arresting like a
blackbird's song, and personal with the ardent love and clear reason of
a child faithfully living and bravely dying, seem to attest a kinship with
seers of truth to whom longer trial has offered a sterner strength of complex
thinking, for wider service here, but who, although they may have
learnt thus '<i>more</i>' in the knowledge of love, "shall never know nor learn
<i>other</i> thing without end."&mdash;"I understood none higher stature in this life
than childhood."

<h3><span class="smcap">The Theme of the Book</span></h3>

<blockquote><p>"The phase of thought or feeling which we call
Mysticism has its origin in ... that dim consciousness
of the <i>beyond</i> which is part of our nature as human beings....
Mysticism arises when we try to bring this higher
consciousness into relation with the other contents of
our minds. Religious Mysticism may be defined as the
attempt to realise the presence of the living God in the
soul and in nature, or, more generally, as the attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
realise in thought and feeling, the immanence of the
temporal in the eternal, and of the eternal in the
temporal."&mdash;W. R. Inge, <i>Christian Mysticism</i>. The
Bampton Lectures for 1900, p. 4.</p></blockquote>


<p>"What is Paradise? All things that are; for all are
goodly and pleasant and therefore may fitly be called a
Paradise. It is said also that Paradise is an outer Court
of Heaven. Even so this world is an outer court of the
eternal, or of Eternity, and especially whatever in time,
or any temporal creature manifesteth or remindeth us of
God or Eternity; for the creature is a guide and a path
to God and Eternity."<a name="FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "God is althing that is gode,
as to my sight," says Julian, "and the godenes that
althing hath, it is He" (<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">viii.</a>).</p>

<p>"<i>Truth seeth God</i>," and every man exercising the
human gift of Reason may in the sight and in the seeing
of truths, attain to some sight of God as Truth. But
"<i>Wisdom beholdeth God</i>," and although the enlightenment
of the Spirit of Wisdom for the discernment of vital
truth is a grace that is granted in needful measure to
him that seeks to be guided by it, it is perhaps those
receivers of grace that are mystics by nature and habit
that are the most ready in reaching forward while still
on earth to Wisdom's fullest and most immediate beholding
of God as All in all. For theirs in the largest (and
it may be the highest) efficiency, and in the fullest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
accordance with man's first gift of "Reason Natural,"
is the further gift that Julian calls "<i>Mind</i>": the gift of
a certain spiritual sensitiveness whereby they are quick
to take impression of eternal things unseen (seeing them
either within or beyond the things of time that are seen)
with surrender of self to partake of their life. For in
this Beholding of Wisdom, response of the heart in
purity and insight of the imagination in faith enhance
each other, while the vision of the soul through both
takes clearness.</p>

<p>The mystic, who sees the wide-ruling oneness of God
with all that is good&mdash;and thus, as the Mystics say, with
all that <i>is</i>,&mdash;may begin at any point the beholding of Goodness
and therein the beholding of God. "He is in the
mydde poynt of all thyng, and all He doeth" (<a href="#THE_THIRD_REVELATION">xi.</a>). It
is in the way of those thus fully endowed for the
reaching to truth in its highest wisdom here, while they
walk amongst the many manifestations of earth, to take
them as delicate partial signs instinct with a single
meaning. Here is mystical perception:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"To see a world in a grain of sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a heaven in a wild flower;<br /></span>

of the spiritual sight Julian relates: "I saw God in a
point.&mdash;by which sight I saw that He is in all things."
To the mystical soul, quiet to listen to "the music of the
spheres," all sweet accordant sounds are singing <i>Holy, Holy,
Holy</i>; to the mystical soul, "full of eyes within"&mdash;like
those <i>Creatures of Life</i> seen on the plain by the prophet
of the Law of life as renewed for Hope, and seen in the
heights by the herald of the Evangel of life as fulfilled
in Love&mdash;all symmetrical sights are as doors that are
opened in Heaven. But it is most of all in the music
and the symmetry made of adverse life and death by the
power of love, as this is seen from highest to lowest,
from lowest to highest, that the Revelation of God as
Love that is All in all is received. And looking thereon
in the highest manifestation, the manifestation of Christ,
which is made for all men, the mystics meet other beholders,
who are not called "mystics," yet who have not
merely in greater or less degree, with them, the common
gift of Reason, but, after their different manner and in
their own share, the gift of the feeling "Mind." For
both from the seeing of Truth and from the beholding
of Wisdom comes the "holy wondering delight in God"
that is simply delight of love in Love. So they of the
East and they of the West sit down together to partake
of the Bread and the Wine of the Table of God in His
Kingdom.</p>

<p>There is no other than one Food of the Divine Life
consecrated and made ready and offered to man for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
human spirit to feed on; but the Christian mystic finds
an offering of that Food, which is the sanctified Life of
the Christ of God, not only in its constant presentment
to the spirit alone, by the Spirit of God through Christ.
To him, as to other Christians, the sight and the offering
of the Life in God is given in that memorial, mediate,
expectant Sacrament consecrated for the spirit's nurture
through those elected Symbols of sense that are the most
perfect and sacred symbols because in their earlier,
natural use they most immediately minister to the whole
human life on earth of the Giver and of the receivers.
But along with this chosen Sacrament, and as one with
it, there is shewn to the mystic the Life Divine in diverse
manners of working: he sees God's Christ from afar,
<i>fore-sees</i> the Eucharistic Sacrament of His most sacred
Death and Life, <i>now</i> raised in the Bread and the Wine
on high,&mdash;seeing its promise low in the ground in the
earliest, ageless life of the wheat and the vine: seed cast
away, bruised corn of wheat, and dying Body, and
broken Bread, and daily obedience; a hidden root,
crushed fruit of the vine, and Blood poured forth, and
uplifted Wine, and joy of Love over Death: one Life.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is for the mystics a partaking of these
lesser "wayside sacraments," sometimes a turning aside
from their symbols; sometimes the old song of life in
the lower creation awakens singing, sometimes it scarcely
is heard. But always the <i>spirit</i> of nature's signs as interpreted
in Man, above all in Christ, lays its claim on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
the soul; always as sung by the chorus of human spirits
that live on the "Righteousness, Peace, and Joy" of the
Will of God, the New Song of Life through Death has
in it a summons and receives from one and another here,
passing through much tribulation, its fuller concord of
human achievement, or at least the desirous <i>Amen</i>. So
whether the mystic dwell much or little with the sights
and sounds of sense, those things that are seen and heard
by the <i>soul</i> bear to him the command of his home, and
the merest doorway glimpses, the echoes most distant,
making their proffer of more and more within and
beyond, say <i>Come</i>.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>(Although this "following on to know," this winding of
the truth caught hold of into a "perfect round" of
thought and will and life, is probably not more easy for
the mystics than for other people.</p>

<p>God is in all; but "our soul may never have rest in
things that are beneath itself" (<a href="#THE_SIXTEENTH_REVELATION">lxvii.</a>). "Well I wot,"
says Julian, "that heaven and earth and all that is made
is great and large, fair and good," yet "all that is made"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
is seen as a little thing, the size of a hazel nut, held in
the palm of her hand, when along with it her spiritual
sight beholds the Maker. And though we may find the
Maker in all things, we find Him, both as Maker and
Restorer, first and best, First and Last, in the soul.
There He is <i>Alpha</i>, there <i>Omega</i>. "It is readier to us
to come to the knowing of God than to know our own
Soul" (in its fullest powers). "For our soul is so
deep-grounded in God and so endlessly treasured, that
we may not come to the knowing thereof till we have
first knowing of God, which is the Maker, to whom it
is oned." And yet, "we may never come to full knowing
of God till we know first clearly our own soul"
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LVI">lvi.</a>). The knowledge begins with God, but it begins
with Him in the lowest place of the soul rescued from
sin by mercy and entered by grace. "For Himself is
nearest and meekest, highest and lowest, and doeth all"
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXX">lxxx.</a>). To the soul that looks on Christ a remembrance
rises of its own "fair nature" made in His image;
yet "our Lord of His mercy sheweth us our sin and our
feebleness by the sweet gracious light of Himself"
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXVIII">lxxviii.</a>). Thus in the working of grace the soul comes
to the knowledge both of its higher and lower parts.
For in finding in itself both a natural response to the
working of grace by its love and its longing after God,
and a contrariness to the goodness of grace by its often
failing and falling, it experiences both the action of the
"Godly Will" (which is within it as a part of, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>
gift from, its higher nature, "the Substance") and the
action of a "beastly will" (from the simple animal
nature) which can will no moral good and which, "failing
of love," falls into sin: whereby comes pain, with
all the "travail" of good and evil in conflict during the
course of restoration. But it is only when the Sense-soul
(wherein the higher will must overcome the lower)
is at last brought up to heaven, enriched by all the
profits of tribulation, and is united to the Substance
waiting there, "hid with Christ in God," that we come
to the perfect knowledge of God. For that knowledge,
perfect in kind though always growing, can only begin
when, being in our "full powers" and "all fully holy,"
we come to know clearly our own united perfected Soul.
This seems to be Julian's view (<a href="#CHAPTER_LVI">lvi.</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>Julian says elsewhere that we have in us here such a
"medley" of good and evil that sometimes we hardly
know of others or of ourselves wherein we stand, but
that each "holy assent" that we make (by the Godly
Will) to the grace and will of God, is a witness that
we are of God. A witness to our sonship, it might be
said; and perhaps, taking Julian's view for the time,
we might think that as the Lost Son "came to himself,"
so the soul comes to the consciousness of the Godly
Will; that as he arose and came to his Father and found
Him, or rather was found by his Father, so the soul
receives the healing of Christ in Mercy and the leading
of the Holy Ghost in Grace; and that as at last, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>
son not only found his father but found his lost sonship&mdash;yet
a better sonship than ever he had known before&mdash;so
the soul comes at last to find, more and more
fully, that new sonship which is of its nature, yet is
more than its nature. For it finds the nature oneness
which by creation it had with the Son of God, enhanced
and for ever sustained by grace.</p>

<p>Sometimes, truly, the Mystical doctrine leads by tracks
that are not easily followed, but it is perhaps only when
her views are regarded in single parts, that any harm
could be found in Julian's statements&mdash;all qualified as
they are by her "as to my sight." At first indeed it
may startle one to read of her saints that are known in
the Church and in Heaven "by their sins," to hear that
the wounds left by sin are made "medicines" on earth
and turned to "worships" in Heaven; but then we
remember the joy that shall be in Heaven over "one
sinner that repenteth," the love that loves much because
much is forgiven. And yet we remember the little
children in <i>their</i> high faith and love and innocent days;
and of such is the Kingdom of God. But the Child,
with many "fair virtues," albeit imperfect, was likewise
Julian's type of the Christian soul: "I understood no
higher stature in this life than Childhood."</p>

<p>"To know our own soul"&mdash;it behoveth us to know
our own soul&mdash;our high-nature soul, which is enclosed
in God, and also our soul on the earth which Christ-Jesus
inhabits, which has in it the "medley": "we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>
have in us our Lord Jesus uprisen, we have in us the
wretchedness and the mischief of Adam's falling, dying"
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LII">lii.</a>). But elsewhere Julian gives this name "our own
soul" to the Church, seeing the Church likewise as the
dwelling and working-place of Christ (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXII">lxii.</a>). She has
been speaking of the Divine Wisdom being as it were
the Mother of the soul, and now she seems to lead us
to the Church as to the Nursery where He tends His
children. "For one single person may oftentimes be
broken, but the whole Body of Holy Church was never
broken, nor ever shall be, without end. And therefore
a sure thing it is, a good and a gracious, to will meekly
and mightily to be fastened to our Mother, Holy Church,
that is Christ Jesus. For the Food of Mercy that is
His dearworthy blood and precious water is plenteous
to make us fair and clean; the sweet gracious hands of
our Mother be ready and diligently about us. For He
in all this working useth the office of a kind nurse
that hath not else to do but to entend about the salvation
of her child" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXI">lxi.</a>). Each soul is indeed the soul
of a person and most intimately knows itself in its personal
experience, through which indeed alone it can come
to knowledge of others. Yet the single soul knows
itself <i>best</i> in the souls of all the saints, in the fellowship
of the "Blessed Common," where every virtue is found,
not in each, at this time, but in <i>all</i>&mdash;not now in the perfect
height nor the fairest flowering, but at growth in that
ground where each plant holds some likeness to Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span></p>

<p>With Julian the Christian Faith is not a thing added
to the Mystical sight: these are, as again and again she
says, seen both as one. It is the <i>inherent</i> Christianity of
her system that makes her teaching always, in a large
way, practical. For the system came at first to be seen
by prayerful searching made out of her practical need
of an answer to the problem of sin and sorrow; the
Mystical Vision came with "contrition, compassion, and
longing after God," those wounds that her contrite,
pitiful, longing heart had desired should be made more
deep in her life. It is through the work of grace that
Julian reaches back to the gift of nature, its ground;
and from the depths of this root-ground she rises soon
again to the "springing and spreading" grace. So in
the First of her Shewings the "higher" truth is seen:
"we are all in Him beclosed," but in the Last&mdash;the
conclusion and confirmation of all&mdash;the lower, yet nearer,
truth, which <i>all</i> may know: "and He is beclosed in
us." And speaking of this dwelling within the soul
she speaks of His working us all into Him: "in which
working He willeth that we be His helpers, giving to
Him all our entending, learning His lores, keeping His
laws, desiring that all be done that He doeth; truly
trusting In Him" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LVII">lvii.</a>).</p>

<p>Julian had prayed to feel Christ's dying pains, if it
should be God's will, in order that she might feel compassion,
and the visionary sight of His pain in the Face
of the Crucifix filled her with pain as it grew upon her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span>
"How might any pain be more to me than to see Him
that is all my life, all my bliss, and all my joy suffer?"
Yet the Shewing of Pain was but the introduction to,
and for a time the accompaniment of, the Revelation;
the Revelation, itself, as a whole, was of Love&mdash;the
Goodness or Active Love of God. So the First Shewing,
as the Ground of all the rest, was a large view of
this Goodness as the Ground of all Being. Although
through these earlier Shewings the Saviour's bodily pain is
felt by Julian so fully in "mind" that she feels it indeed
as if it were bodily anguish she bore, it is in this very
experience that the shewing of Joy is made to her spirit.
So when in the opening of the Revelation she tells
of beholding the Passion of Christ, her first unexpected
word is of sudden joy from the inner sight of the Love
that God is: the sight of the Trinity:&mdash;"And in the
same Shewing suddenly the Trinity fulfilled my heart
most of joy. (For where JESUS appeareth, the blessed
Trinity is understood, as to my sight.)" And even
as Julian finds afterwards that the Last Word of the
Revelation is the same as the First: "<i>Thou shalt not be
overcome</i>," so the opening Sight already shews her that
which shall be revealed all through, for learning of
"more in the same," and uplifts her heart to the fulness
of joy that is shewn at the close. For she feels that
this shock, as it were, of Revelation&mdash;this sudden joy of
seeing Love in the midst of earth's evil, beyond and
beneath and in the pain that is passing, is the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
into the joy of the Lord. "Suddenly the Trinity
fulfilled my heart with utmost joy.&mdash;And so I understood
it shall be in heaven without end to all that shall
come there" (<a href="#THE_FIRST_REVELATION">iv.</a>). So at the close, when the vision
was not of the Love Divine in that bending Face
beneath the Crown of Thorns, but of the human love
that shall spring up to meet the Divine out of the lowness
of earth,&mdash;the vision of how from this body of
death, as from an unsightly, shapeless, and stagnant
mass of quagmire, there "sprang a full fair creature, a
little Child, fully shapen and formed, agile and lively,
whiter than lily; which swiftly glided up into heaven"&mdash;the
spiritual shewing to the soul is this: "<i>Suddenly
thou shalt be taken from all thy pain ... and thou shalt
come up above and thou shalt have me ... and thou shalt be
fulfilled of love and of bliss</i>" (<a href="#THE_FIFTEENTH_REVELATION">lxiv.</a>). And so in that early
experience of Julian's when in her love, abandoned to
pity and worship, she would not look up to Heaven
from the Cross, it was also the inward sight by the
higher part of her soul of the higher part of Christ's
life, that Heavenly Love that could only rejoice, that
overcame her frailty of flesh unwilling to suffer, and
made her choose "only Jesus in weal and in woe."
"Thou art my Heaven" (<a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">xix.-lv.</a>). "All the Trinity
wrought in the Passion of Jesus Christ," though only
the Son of the Virgin suffered, and in seeing this, Julian
saw "the Bliss of Christ's works," "the joy that is in
the blissful Trinity [by reason] of the Passion of Christ";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>

"the Father willing all, the Son working all, the Holy
Ghost confirming all."</p>

<p>This complexity of the Divine-Human life in the Son
of God, this union in Christ Jesus of serene untouched
blessedness in the heavenly regions of His spirit with
His bearing, in the active joy of a "glad giver," all the
sin and sorrow of the world, is revealed as the comfort
and confidence of man, whose own deepest experience
is love that suffers, whose highest worship therefore
must be of Love that is strong to suffer.</p>

<p>It was a double joy that was shewn in Christ besides
the bliss of the impassible Godhead, which is the bliss
of Love without all time and beyond all deeds. For
there was joy in the Passion itself: "<i>If I might suffer
more, I would suffer more</i>," and joy in its fruits: "<i>If thou
art pleased, I am pleased</i>." Thus, too, we are told of
three ways in which our Lord would have us behold
His Passion: first, "the hard pains He suffered on
earth"; second, "the love that made Him to suffer
passeth as far all His pains as Heaven is above earth";
third, "the joy and the bliss that made Him to be well-satisfied
in it."&mdash;"With a glad countenance He looked
unto His wounded Side, rejoicing" (<a href="#THE_NINTH_REVELATION">xxii.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII">xxiii.</a>,
<a href="#THE_TENTH_REVELATION">xxiv.</a>).</p>

<p>From the sight of Love that is higher than pain comes
the sight of Love that is deeper than sin. Julian had
had the mystical shewing that God is all that is good,<a name="FNanchor_6_28" id="FNanchor_6_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_28" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span>
and is only good, is the life of all that is, and doeth
all that is done, and she had reasoned, as others before
her had reasoned, that therefore "sin hath no substance"
and "sin is no deed." But perhaps it is those
that are most concerned with God in creature things,
that suffer most shaking from the sight of evil. Those
that seek God's Kingdom in this present world, finding
"the dark places of the earth" full of the habitations
of cruelty, have continually the enemy as with
a sword in their bones saying within them: "Where is
now thy God?" "I saw," says Julian, "that He is in
all things. I beheld and considered, with a soft dread,
and thought: <i>What is sin?</i>" (<a href="#THE_THIRD_REVELATION">xi.</a>). So also it is immediately
after the coming of the mystical Shewing made
"yet more highly": "<i>It is I, it is I, it is I that am all</i>,"
that the memory of her own experience is brought to
her and she sees how in her longings after God, who is
all the time so close about us, around us and within,&mdash;she
had always been hindered from seeing and reaching
Him fully by the darkening, disturbing power of sin.
"And so I looked generally upon us all, and methought:
<i>If sin had not been, we should have all been clean, and like
to our Lord as He made us</i>" (<a href="#THE_THIRTEENTH_REVELATION">xxvii.</a>). Thus came
again the stirring of that old question over which
"afore this time often I wondered," with "mourning
and sorrow," "why the beginning of sin was not letted&mdash;for
then, methought, all should have been well."</p>

<p>To this darkness, crying to God, the light came first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span>
as by a soft general dawning of comfort for faith. "<i>Sin
is behoveable</i> (it behoved that sin should be suffered to
rise) <i>but all shall be well, and all shall be well, and all
manner of things shall be well.</i>" Yet Julian, unable to
take comfort to her heart over that which was still so
dark to her intellect, stands "beholding things general,
troublously and mourning," saying thus in her thoughts:
"<i>Ah good Lord, how might all be</i> well, for the great hurt
that is come by sin to the creature?" (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXIX">xxix.</a>).</p>

<p>The answer to this double question as to sin and pain
is the central theme of the Revelation, though much is
still hidden and much is but dimly revealed as yet to
faith. In brief account, the sight, enough for us now,
is this: "Mercy, by love, suffereth us to fail [of love]
in measure, and in as much as we fail, in so much we
die: for it needs must be that we die in so much as we
fail of the sight and feeling of God that is our life....
And grace worketh our dreadful failing into plenteous,
endless solace, and grace worketh our shameful falling
into high, worshipful rising; and grace worketh our
sorrowful dying into holy, blissful life" (<a href="#CHAPTER_XLVIII">xlviii.</a>). "By
the assay of this falling we shall have an high marvellous
knowing of love in God, without end. For
strong and marvellous is that love that may not and will
not be broken for trespass. And this is one understanding
of our profit. Another is the lowness and
meekness that we shall get by the sight of our falling"
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LXI">lxi.</a>). "And by this meek knowing after this manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>
through contrition and grace, we shall be broken from
all that is not our Lord. And then shall our blessed
Saviour perfectly heal us and one us to Him"
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXVIII">lxxviii.</a>).</p>

<p><i>Theodidacta, Profunda, Ecstatica</i>&mdash;so Julian has been
designated; perhaps she might in fuller truth be called
<i>Theodidacta, Profunda, Evangelica</i>. She is indeed a mystic,
evangelical, practical. With all her fellow-Christians
and in the most deeply personal concern she looks with
a tender mind on the redeeming work of God by Christ
in the "glorious satisfaction" ("<i>Asseth</i>"), and in
fervent response of love and thankfulness trusts in the
blessed Passion of Christ, and in His sure keeping, and
in all the restoring, fulfilling work by the Holy Ghost.
But after the Mystical manner she seeks "the beyond":
that is, while in no way leaving the works of mercy
and grace she seeks to go back to the ground or source
of them, the Goodness of God,&mdash;yes, to God Himself.
"I could not have perceived of the part of Mercy but
as it were alone in Love." "The Passion was a noble
worshipful deed done in a time, but Love was without
beginning, is, and shall be without ending."</p>

<p>The Mystical Vision is that which in outward nature
sees the unseen within the seen, but it is also that
which in spiritual things sees behind and beyond the
temporal means, the eternal causes and ends (<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">vi.</a>).
And it is surely here in the spiritual things, in the
heart and centre of human existence, in the stress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span>
sin and suffering, rather than amongst the gentle growing
things, and flaming lights, and songs, and blameless
creatures of Nature that the Beatific Vision on earth is
at its highest. For here are found united the <i>Evangel</i>
and the <i>Vision</i> and the <i>Life</i> of love. "There the soul
is highest, noblest, and worthiest, where it is lowest,
meekest, and mildest": it is not in nature's goodness
alone that we have our life, "all our life is in three," in
nature, in mercy, in grace; "whereof we have meekness,
mildness, patience and pity" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LVIII">lviii.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LIX">lix.</a>). Man's
"spirit," the higher nature that Julian talks of, may
indeed be there in the Heavenly places, as an infant's
angel lying in the Father's arms, always beholding His
Face in love's silence of waiting; but here in earthly
places is the Prodigal Son returning, here too is the
Father's embrace, and here is His earliest greeting of
the son that was lost and is found. And already here
in the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth (where <i>all</i> grow
pure in the sonship obedience of Jesus Christ), are
those that are kept from the first as little children, taken
up in His arms and suffered to sing their Hosannahs,
which perfect His praise.</p>

<p>The Revelation of Love is all centred in the Passion,
and looking on the Passion in time the soul sees, in
vision, the Lamb that was slain from the foundation
of the world, the mind conceives how before all time
the Divine Love took to itself in the Wisdom of God
the mode of Manhood, and in time created Man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span>
same, and how thus God could be and do all that man
could be and do, could exercise Love Divine in human
Faith and Courage: could "take our flesh" and live
on the earth as "the Man, Christ-Jesus," "in all points
tempted like as we are," finding His daily Bread in the
will of the Father, drinking with joy of the Wine of
life in the evening cup of Death. "Pain is passing,"
says Julian, but in passing it leads forth love in man to
its deepest living, its fairest height of pureness and
strength and fulfilment. Thus it behoved the Captain
of man's salvation to have His perfection here through
suffering. It is the <i>Lamb</i> in the midst of the Throne,
the Almighty Love that was slain, that is Shepherd to
the Martyrs, leading them unto living fountains of
waters. He that bore the yoke gives rest to the
heavy-laden; blessed is He that mourned: for He
comforteth with His comfort.</p>

<p>So in the Mediæval story,<a name="FNanchor_8_29" id="FNanchor_8_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_29" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the highest Mystical
Vision, the sight of the Holy Grail, comes only to
him that is pure from self, and looks on the bleeding
wound that sin has left in man, and is compassionate,
and gives himself to service and healing.&mdash;<i>Can ye</i> drink <i>of
the Cup I drank of?</i>&mdash;Love's Cup that is Death and Life.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Wine of Love's joy I see thy cup<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Red to the trembling brim<br /></span>
With Life outpoured, once lifted up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I drink, remembering Him.&mdash;<br /></span>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the mourners who are comforted: those that
bear griefs of their own, or bear griefs of others fully,
do not despair, though the mere onlooker may well
despair. Thus the compassionate Julian's vision is of
<i>Comfort</i>&mdash;comfort not for herself "in special," but for
"the general Man"&mdash;for all her fellow-Christians.
She who had long time mourned for the hurt that is
come by sin to the creature, came to the sight of
comfort not by turning her eyes away but by deeper
compassion that found through the very wounds the
healing of Love on earth, the glory of Love in Heaven.
She was "filled with compassion for the Passion of
Christ," and thus she saw <i>His joy</i>; so afterwards, she
tells, "I was fulfilled in part with compassion of all
mine even-Christians, for that well, well-beloved people
that shall be saved. For God's servants, Holy Church,
shall be shaken in sorrow and anguish and tribulation in
this world, as men shake a cloth in the wind. And as to
this our Lord answered in this manner: A great thing
shall I make hereof in Heaven of endless worship and
everlasting joys. Yea so far forth as this I saw: that
our Lord joyeth of the tribulations of His servants, with
ruth and compassion." "For He saith: <i>I shall wholly
break you of your vain affections and of your vicious pride: and
after that I shall together gather you, and make you mild and
meek, clean and holy, by oneing to me</i>" (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXVIII">xxviii.</a>). Sin is indeed
"the sharpest scourge," "viler and more painful
than hell, without comparison," "an horrible thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span>
see for the loved soul that would be all fair and shining
in the sight of God, as Nature and Grace teacheth." And
darkness, which overhangs the soul while here it is
"meddling with any part of sin," "so that we see not
clearly the Blissful Countenance of our Lord," is a lasting,
life-long "natural penance" from God, the feeling of
which indeed does not depart with actual sinning: "for
ever the more clearly that the soul seeth this Blissful
Countenance by grace of loving, the more it longeth to
see it in fulness" (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXII">lxxii.</a>). All this is in man's experience,
with many other pains&mdash;pains which in individual
lives have no proportionate relation to sin, though, in
general, "sin is cause of pain" and "pain purgeth."&mdash;("<i>For
I tell thee, howsoever thou do thou shalt have woe</i>"),
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXVII">lxxvii.</a>, <a href="#THE_THIRTEENTH_REVELATION">xxvii.</a>). But the Comfort Revealed shews how
sin, which "hath no part of being" and "could not be
known but by the pain it is cause of," (sin which in
this view may be compared to the nails of the Passion&mdash;mere
dead matter, though with power to wound unto
death for a time the blessed Life), sin, which is failure
of human love,&mdash;leaves, notwithstanding all its horror,
an opening for a fuller influx of Divine love and strength.<a name="FNanchor_9_30" id="FNanchor_9_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_30" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
And as to <i>darkness</i>, "seeking is as good as beholding, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>
the time that God will suffer the soul to be in travail"
(<a href="#THE_SECOND_REVELATION">x.</a>). And as to tribulation of every kind, "the Passion
of our Lord is comfort to us against all this, and so is
His blessed will" (<a href="#THE_THIRTEENTH_REVELATION">xxvii.</a>).</p>

<p>The parts may seem to come by chance and to be
"amiss," but the whole, and in the whole each part, is
ordered. "And when we be all brought up above, then
shall we see clearly in God the secret things which be
now hid to us. Then shall none of us be stirred to say:
<i>Lord, if it had been thus, then it had been full well</i>: but we
shall all say with <i>one</i> voice: <i>Lord, blessed mayst Thou be,
for it is thus: it is well; and now we see verily that all
things are done as it was then ordained before that anything
was made</i>" (<a href="#THE_THIRD_REVELATION">xi.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXV">lxxxv.</a>). "Moreover He that shall be
our bliss when we are there, is our Keeper while we are
here"; and the Last Word of the Revelation is the same
as the First; "<i>Thou shalt not be overcome.</i>" "He said not:
<i>Thou shalt not be tempested, thou shalt not be travailed, thou shalt
not be distressed</i>; but He said: <i>Thou shalt not be overcome.</i>"</p>

<p>This is God's comfort. And that here, meanwhile,
we should take His comfort is Julian's chief desire and
instruction. For Julian, who speaking so much of sin
as a strange and troubling sight, yet gives as examples
of sin only a slothful mistrusting despondency,&mdash;speaks
indeed of faith and hope and charity, compassion
and meekness, but scarcely <i>exhorts</i> except to the
cheerful enduring of tribulation. So she gives counsel
as to "rejoicing more in His whole love than sorrowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</a></span>
in our often fallings"; as to "living gladly and merrily
for love's sake" in our penance of darkness (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXII">lxxii.-lxxxi.</a>).
And in general, for all experiences of life, "It is God's
will that we take His promises and His comfortings as
largely and as mightily as we may take them, and also
He willeth that we take our abiding and our troubles as
lightly as we may take them, and set them at nought"
(<a href="#THE_FIFTEENTH_REVELATION">lxiv.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXV">lxv.</a>, <a href="#THE_SEVENTH_REVELATION">xv.</a>).</p>

<p>"We are all one in comfort," says Julian, "all the
gracious comfort was for all mine even-Christians." Sin
separates, pain isolates, but salvation and comfort unite.</p>

<p>And lastly, in this mystical vision of the oneness of
man with God in Christ, man is seen not only as united in
himself in the diverse parts of his nature, and as one with
his fellow man, but as joined to that which is below him.
How often of one good and another, as of that fair and
sacred "service of the Mother"&mdash;"nearest, readiest,
and surest"&mdash;"in the creatures by whom it is done,"
do we hear Julian's confident word of Sacramental
declaration: "<i>It is Christ</i>." "For God is all that is
good, as to my sight, and God hath made all that is
made: and he that loveth generally all his even-Christians
for God, he loveth all that is. For in Mankind
that shall be saved is comprehended all: that is to
say, all that is made and the Maker of all. For in Man
is God, and God is in all. And I hope," adds Julian,
in words that are fitting to take for her courteous, her
tender, "<i>Good Speed</i>" ere we pass to her book&mdash;altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span>
like her as they are, even to the careful, conditional "if"
(for <i>nothing,</i> not even comfort, behoves to be "overdone
much"), "I hope by the grace of God he that beholdeth
it thus shall be truly taught and mightily comforted, if
he needeth comfort" (<a href="#CHAPTER_IX">ix.</a>).</p>

<p><i>Deus ubique est, et totus ubique est.</i> All things are
gathered up in Man, and Man is gathered up in Christ;
and Christ is gathered up in the Bosom of the Father.
So the world of the lower creation makes promise: <i>All
things are yours</i>; and the Church says over its offering,
lifted up: <i>Ye are Christ's</i>; and from the stillness the
voice of peace is heard: <i>And Christ is God's</i>. "All the
promises of God in <span class="smcap">Him</span> are <i>Yea</i> and in <span class="smcap">Him</span> <i>Amen</i>, unto
the glory of God by us." All the promises of God: the
blossom that floated to the ground; "the lily of a day"
that "fell and died that night"; the "little Child,
whiter than lily, that swiftly glided up into Heaven"&mdash;all
the utterances silenced here&mdash;in Him are <i>Yea</i> and
in Him <i>Amen: Yea</i> on earth and <i>Amen</i> for ever. "<i>He
turneth the shadow of death into the morning.</i>"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"A Revelation of Love&mdash;in Sixteen Shewings"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>This is a Revelation of Love that Jesus Christ, our
endless bliss, made in Sixteen Shewings, or
Revelations particular.</p>

<p>Of the which the First is of His precious crowning
with thorns; and therewith was comprehended and
specified the Trinity, with the Incarnation, and unity
betwixt God and man's soul; with many fair shewings
of endless wisdom and teachings of love: in which
all the Shewings that follow be grounded and oned.<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Second is the changing of colour of His fair
face in token of His dearworthy<a name="FNanchor_2_32" id="FNanchor_2_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_32" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Passion.</p>

<p>The Third is that our Lord God, Allmighty Wisdom,
All-Love, right as verily as He hath made everything
that is, all-so verily He doeth and worketh all-thing
that is done.</p>

<p>The Fourth is the scourging of His tender body, with
plenteous shedding of His blood.</p>

<p>The Fifth is that the Fiend is overcome by the
precious Passion of Christ.</p>

<p>The Sixth is the worshipful<a name="FNanchor_3_33" id="FNanchor_3_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_33" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> thanking by our Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
God in which He rewardeth His blessed servants in
Heaven.</p>

<p>The Seventh is [our] often feeling of weal and woe;
(the feeling of weal is gracious touching and lightening,
with true assuredness of endless joy; the feeling of woe
is temptation by heaviness and irksomeness of our fleshly
living;) with ghostly understanding that we are kept
all as securely in Love in woe as in weal, by the Goodness
of God.</p>

<p>The Eighth is of the last pains of Christ, and His
cruel dying.</p>

<p>The Ninth is of the pleasing which is in the Blissful
Trinity by the hard Passion of Christ and His rueful
dying: in which joy and pleasing He willeth that we be
solaced and mirthed<a name="FNanchor_4_34" id="FNanchor_4_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_34" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with Him, till when we come to the
fulness in Heaven.</p>

<p>The Tenth is, our Lord Jesus sheweth in love His
blissful heart even cloven in two, rejoicing.</p>

<p>The Eleventh is an high ghostly Shewing of His
dearworthy Mother.</p>

<p>The Twelfth is that our Lord is most worthy Being.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth is that our Lord God willeth we have
great regard to all the deeds that He hath done: in the
great nobleness of the making of all things; and the excellency
of man's making, which is above all his works;
and the precious Amends<a name="FNanchor_5_35" id="FNanchor_5_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_35" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that He hath made for man's
sin, turning all our blame into endless worship.<a name="FNanchor_6_36" id="FNanchor_6_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_36" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In
which Shewing also our Lord saith: <i>Behold and see! For
by the same Might, Wisdom, and Goodness that I have done
all this, by the same Might, Wisdom, and Goodness I shall</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<i>make well all that is not well; and thou shalt see it.</i> And in
this He willeth that we keep us in the Faith and truth
of Holy Church, not desiring to see into His secret
things now, save as it belongeth to us in this life.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth is that our Lord is the Ground of our
Prayer. Herein were seen two properties: the one is
rightful prayer, the other is steadfast trust; which He
willeth should both be alike large; and thus our prayer
pleaseth Him and He of His Goodness fulfilleth it.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth is that we shall suddenly be taken from
all our pain and from all our woe, and of His Goodness
we shall come up above, where we shall have our Lord
Jesus for our meed and be fulfilled with joy and bliss in
Heaven.</p>

<p>The Sixteenth is that the Blissful Trinity, our Maker,
in Christ Jesus our Saviour endlessly dwelleth in our
soul, worshipfully ruling and protecting all things, us
mightily and wisely saving and keeping, for love; and
we shall not be overcome of our Enemy.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"A simple creature unlettered.&mdash;Which creature afore desired
three gifts of God"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>These Revelations were shewed to a simple creature
unlettered,<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the year of our Lord 1373, the Thirteenth
day of May. Which creature [had] afore desired
three gifts of God. The First was mind of His Passion;
the Second was bodily sickness in youth, at thirty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of age; the Third was to have of God's gift three
wounds.</p>

<p>As to the First, methought I had some feeling in the
Passion of Christ, but yet I desired more by the grace of
God. Methought I would have been that time with Mary
Magdalene, and with other that were Christ's lovers, and
therefore I desired a bodily sight wherein I might have
more knowledge of the bodily pains of our Saviour and
of the compassion of our Lady and of all His true lovers
that saw, that time, His pains. For I would be one of
them and suffer with Him. Other sight nor shewing of
God desired I never none, till the soul were disparted
from the body. The cause of this petition was that
after the shewing I should have the more true mind in
the Passion of Christ.</p>

<p>The Second came to my mind with contrition; [I]
freely desiring that sickness [to be] so hard as to death,
that I might in that sickness receive all my rites of Holy
Church, myself thinking that I should die, and that all
creatures might suppose the same that saw me: for
I would have no manner of comfort of earthly life. In
this sickness I desired to have all manner of pains bodily
and ghostly that I should have if I should die, (with all
the dreads and tempests of the fiends) except the outpassing
of the soul. And this I meant<a name="FNanchor_2_38" id="FNanchor_2_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_38" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for [that] I
would be purged, by the mercy of God, and afterward
live more to the worship of God because of that sickness.
And that for the more furthering<a name="FNanchor_3_39" id="FNanchor_3_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_39" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in my death:
for I desired to be soon with my God.</p>

<p>These two desires of the Passion and the sickness I
desired with a condition, saying thus: <i>Lord, Thou knowest</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<i>what I would,&mdash;if it be Thy will that I have it&mdash;; and if it
be not Thy will, good Lord, be not displeased: for I will nought
but as Thou wilt.</i></p>

<p>For the Third [petition], by the grace of God and
teaching of Holy Church I conceived a mighty desire to
receive three wounds in my life: that is to say, the
wound of very contrition, the wound of kind<a name="FNanchor_4_40" id="FNanchor_4_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_40" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> compassion,
and the wound of steadfast<a name="FNanchor_5_41" id="FNanchor_5_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_41" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> longing toward God.<a name="FNanchor_6_42" id="FNanchor_6_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_42" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
And all this last petition I asked without any condition.</p>

<p>These two desires aforesaid passed from my mind, but
the third dwelled with me continually.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"I desired to suffer with Him"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And when I was thirty years old and a half, God
sent me a bodily sickness, in which I lay three
days and three nights; and on the fourth night I took all
my rites of Holy Church, and weened not to have lived
till day. And after this I languored forth<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> two days
and two nights, and on the third night I weened oftentimes
to have passed;<a name="FNanchor_2_44" id="FNanchor_2_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_44" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and so weened they that were
with me.</p>

<p>And being in youth as yet, I thought it great sorrow
to die;&mdash;but for nothing that was in earth that meliked
to live for, nor for no pain that I had fear of: for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
trusted in God of His mercy. But it was to have lived
that I might have loved God better, and longer time,
that I might have the more knowing and loving of God
in bliss of Heaven. For methought all the time that I
had lived here so little and so short in regard of that
endless bliss,&mdash;I thought [it was as] nothing. Wherefore
I thought: <i>Good Lord, may my living no longer be to Thy
worship!</i><a name="FNanchor_3_45" id="FNanchor_3_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_45" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And I understood by my reason and by my
feeling of my pains that I should die; and I assented
fully with all the will of my heart to be at God's will.</p>

<p>Thus I dured till day, and by then my body was dead
from the middle downwards, as to my feeling. Then
was I minded to be set upright, backward leaning, with
help,&mdash;for to have more freedom of my heart to be at
God's will, and thinking on God while my life would
last.</p>

<p>My Curate was sent for to be at my ending, and by
that time when he came I had set my eyes, and might<a name="FNanchor_4_46" id="FNanchor_4_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_46" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
not speak. He set the Cross before my face and said:
<i>I have brought thee the Image of thy Maker and Saviour: look
thereupon and comfort thee therewith</i>.</p>

<p>Methought I was well [as it was], for my eyes were
set uprightward unto Heaven, where I trusted to come
by the mercy of God; but nevertheless I assented to set
my eyes on the face of the Crucifix, if I might;<a name="FNanchor_5_47" id="FNanchor_5_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_47" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and so
I did. For methought I might longer dure to look even-forth<a name="FNanchor_6_48" id="FNanchor_6_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_48" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
than right up.</p>

<p>After this my sight began to fail, and it was all dark
about me in the chamber, as if it had been night, save in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the Image of the Cross whereon I beheld a common
light; and I wist not how. All that was away from<a name="FNanchor_7_49" id="FNanchor_7_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_49" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
the Cross was of horror to me, as if it had been greatly
occupied by the fiends.</p>

<p>After this the upper<a name="FNanchor_8_50" id="FNanchor_8_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_50" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> part of my body began to die,
so far forth that scarcely I had any feeling;&mdash;with shortness
of breath. And then I weened in sooth to have
passed.</p>

<p>And in this [moment] suddenly all my pain was taken
from me, and I was as whole (and specially in the upper
part of my body) as ever I was afore.</p>

<p>I marvelled at this sudden change; for methought it
was a privy working of God, and not of nature. And
yet by the feeling of this ease I trusted never the more
to live; nor was the feeling of this ease any full ease
unto me: for methought I had liefer have been delivered
from this world.</p>

<p>Then came suddenly to my mind that I should desire
the second wound of our Lord's gracious gift: that my
body might be fulfilled with mind and feeling of His
blessed Passion. For I would that His pains were my
pains, with compassion and afterward longing to God.
But in this I desired never bodily sight nor shewing of
God, but compassion such as a kind<a name="FNanchor_9_51" id="FNanchor_9_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_51" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> soul might have
with our Lord Jesus, that for love would be a mortal
man: and therefore I desired to suffer with Him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"I saw ... as it were in the time of His Passion.... And
in the same Shewing suddenly the Trinity filled my heart
with utmost joy"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>In this [moment] suddenly I saw the red blood trickle
down from under the Garland hot and freshly and
right plenteously, as it were in the time of His Passion
when the Garland of thorns was pressed on His blessed
head who was both God and Man, the same that suffered
thus for me. I conceived truly and mightily that it was
Himself shewed it me, without any mean.<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>And in the same Shewing suddenly the Trinity fulfilled
my heart most of joy. And so I understood it
shall be in heaven without end to all that shall come
there. For the Trinity is God: God is the Trinity;
the Trinity is our Maker and Keeper, the Trinity is our
everlasting love and everlasting joy and bliss, by our
Lord Jesus Christ. And this was shewed in the First
[Shewing] and in all: for where Jesus appeareth, the
blessed Trinity is understood, as to my sight.</p>

<p>And I said: <i>Benedicite Domine!</i> This I said for
reverence in my meaning, with mighty voice; and full
greatly was astonied for wonder and marvel that I
had, that He that is so reverend and dreadful will be
so homely with a sinful creature living in wretched
flesh.</p>

<p>This [Shewing] I took for the time of my temptation,&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
methought by the sufferance of God I should be
tempted of fiends ere I died. Through this sight of the
blessed Passion, with the Godhead that I saw in mine
understanding, I knew well that <i>It</i> was strength enough
for me, yea, and for all creatures living, against all the
fiends of hell and ghostly temptation.</p>

<p>In this [Shewing] He brought our blessed Lady to my
understanding. I saw her ghostly, in bodily likeness: a
simple maid and a meek, young of age and little waxen
above a child, in the stature that she was when she conceived.
Also God shewed in part the wisdom and the
truth of her soul: wherein I understood the reverent
beholding in which she beheld her God and Maker,
marvelling with great reverence that He would be born
of her that was a simple creature of His making. And
this wisdom and truth: knowing the greatness of her
Maker and the littleness of herself that was made,&mdash;caused
her to say full meekly to Gabriel: <i>Lo me, God's
handmaid!</i> In this sight<a name="FNanchor_2_53" id="FNanchor_2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_53" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I understood soothly that she
is more than all that God made beneath her in worthiness
and grace; for above her is nothing that is made
but the blessed [Manhood]<a name="FNanchor_3_54" id="FNanchor_3_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_54" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of Christ, as to my sight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"God, of Thy Goodness, give me Thyself;&mdash;only in Thee
I have all"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>In this same time our Lord shewed me a spiritual<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
sight of His homely loving.</p>

<p>I saw that He is to us everything that is good and
comfortable for us: He is our clothing that for love
wrappeth us, claspeth us, and all encloseth<a name="FNanchor_2_56" id="FNanchor_2_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_56" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> us for
tender love, that He may never leave us; being to us
all-thing that is good, as to mine understanding.</p>

<p>Also in this He shewed me a little thing, the quantity
of an hazel-nut, in the palm of my hand; and it was as
round as a ball. I looked thereupon with eye of my
understanding, and thought: <i>What may this be?</i> And it
was answered generally thus: <i>it is all that is made.</i> I
marvelled how it might last, for methought it might
suddenly have fallen to naught for little[ness]. And I
was answered in my understanding: <i>It lasteth, and ever
shall [last] for that God loveth it.</i> And so All-thing hath
the Being by the love of God.</p>

<p>In this Little Thing I saw three properties. The first
is that God made it, the second is that God loveth it,
the third, that God keepeth it. But what is to me verily
the Maker, the Keeper, and the Lover,&mdash;I cannot tell;
for till I am Substantially oned<a name="FNanchor_3_57" id="FNanchor_3_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_57" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to Him, I may never have
full rest nor very bliss: that is to say, till I be so
fastened to Him, that there is right nought that is made
betwixt my God and me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>It needeth us to have knowing of the littleness of
creatures and to hold as nought<a name="FNanchor_4_58" id="FNanchor_4_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_58" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> all-thing that is made,
for to love and have God that is unmade. For this is
the cause why we be not all in ease of heart and soul:
that we seek here rest in those things that are so little,
wherein is no rest, and know not our God that is All-mighty,
All-wise, All-good. For He is the Very Rest.
God willeth to be known, and it pleaseth Him that we
rest in Him; for all that is beneath Him sufficeth not
us. And this is the cause why that no soul is rested
till it is made nought as to all<a name="FNanchor_5_59" id="FNanchor_5_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_59" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> things that are made.
When it is willingly made nought, for love, to have
Him that is all, then is it able to receive spiritual rest.</p>

<p>Also our Lord God shewed that it is full great
pleasance to Him that a helpless soul come to Him
simply and plainly and homely. For this is the natural
yearnings of the soul, by the touching of the Holy
Ghost (as by the understanding that I have in this
Shewing): <i>God, of Thy Goodness, give me Thyself: for Thou
art enough to me, and I may nothing ask that is less that may
be full worship to Thee; and if I ask anything that is less, ever
me wanteth,&mdash;but only in Thee I have all.</i></p>

<p>And these words are full lovely to the soul, and full
near touch they the will of God and His Goodness.
For His Goodness comprehendeth all His creatures and
all His blessed works, and overpasseth<a name="FNanchor_6_60" id="FNanchor_6_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_60" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> without end.
For He is the endlessness, and He hath made us only to
Himself, and restored us by His blessed Passion, and
keepeth us in His blessed love; and all this of His
Goodness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"The Goodness of God is the highest prayer, and it cometh
down to the lowest part of our need"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>This Shewing was made to learn our soul wisely to
cleave to the Goodness of God.</p>

<p>And in that time the custom of our praying was
brought to mind: how we use for lack of understanding
and knowing of Love, to take many means [whereby to
beseech Him].<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Then saw I truly that it is more worship to God, and
more very delight, that we faithfully<a name="FNanchor_2_62" id="FNanchor_2_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_62" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> pray to Himself
of His Goodness and cleave thereunto by His Grace,
with true understanding, and steadfast by love, than if
we took all the means that heart can think. For if
we took all these means, it is too little, and not full
worship to God: but in His Goodness is all the whole,
and <i>there</i> faileth right nought.</p>

<p>For this, as I shall tell, came to my mind in the same
time: We pray to God for [the sake of] His holy flesh
and His precious blood, His holy Passion, His dearworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
death and wounds: and all the blessed kindness,<a name="FNanchor_3_63" id="FNanchor_3_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_63" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
the endless life that we have of all this, is His Goodness.
And we pray Him for [the sake of] His sweet Mother's
love that Him bare; and all the help we have of her is
of His Goodness. And we pray by His holy Cross that
he died on, and all the virtue and the help that we have
of the Cross, it is of His Goodness. And on the same
wise, all the help that we have of special saints and all
the blessed Company of Heaven, the dearworthy love
and endless friendship that we have of them, it is of His
Goodness. For God of His Goodness hath ordained
means to help us, full fair and many: of which the
chief and principal mean is the blessed nature that He
took of the Maid, with all the means that go afore and
come after which belong to our redemption and to endless
salvation. Wherefore it pleaseth Him that we seek
Him and worship through means, understanding that He
is the Goodness of all.</p>

<p>For the Goodness of God is the highest prayer, and
it cometh down to the lowest part of our need. It
quickeneth our soul and bringeth it on life, and maketh
it for to waxen in grace and virtue. It is nearest in
nature; and readiest in grace: for <i>it</i> is the same grace
that the soul seeketh, and ever shall seek till we know
verily that He hath us all in Himself enclosed.</p>

<p>For He hath no despite of that He hath made, nor
hath He any disdain to serve us at the simplest office
that to our body belongeth in nature, for love of the
soul that He hath made to His own likeness.</p>

<p>For as the body is clad in the cloth, and the flesh in
the skin, and the bones in the flesh, and the heart in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
whole,<a name="FNanchor_4_64" id="FNanchor_4_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_64" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> so are we, soul and body, clad in the Goodness
of God, and enclosed. Yea, and more homely: for all
these may waste and wear away, but the Goodness of
God is ever whole; and more near to us, without any
likeness; for truly our Lover desireth that our soul
cleave to Him with all its might, and that we be ever-more
cleaving to His Goodness. For of all things that
heart may think, this pleaseth most God, and soonest
speedeth [the soul].</p>

<p>For our soul is so specially loved of Him that is
highest, that it overpasseth the knowing of all creatures:
that is to say, there is no creature that is made that may
[fully] know<a name="FNanchor_5_65" id="FNanchor_5_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_65" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> how much and how sweetly and how
tenderly our Maker loveth us. And therefore we may
with grace and His help stand in spiritual beholding,
with everlasting marvel of this high, overpassing, inestimable<a name="FNanchor_6_66" id="FNanchor_6_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_66" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Love that Almighty God hath to us of His
Goodness. And therefore we may ask of our Lover
with reverence all that we will.</p>

<p>For our natural<a name="FNanchor_7_67" id="FNanchor_7_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_67" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Will is to have God, and the Good
Will of God is to have us; and we may never cease
from willing nor from longing till we have Him in fullness
of joy: and then may we no more desire.</p>

<p>For He willeth that we be occupied in knowing and
loving till the time that we shall be fulfilled in Heaven;
and therefore was this lesson of Love shewed, with all
that followeth, as ye shall see. For the strength and
the Ground of all was shewed in the First Sight. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of all things the beholding and the loving of the Maker
maketh the soul to seem less in his own sight, and most
filleth him with reverent dread and true meekness; with
plenty of charity to his even-Christians.<a name="FNanchor_8_68" id="FNanchor_8_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_68" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"The Shewing is not other than of faith, nor less nor more"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And [it was] to learn us this, as to mine understanding,
[that] our Lord God shewed our Lady Saint
Mary in the same time: that is to say, the high Wisdom
and Truth <i>she</i> had in beholding of her Maker so great,
so holy, so mighty, and so good. This greatness and
this nobleness of the beholding of God fulfilled her with
reverent dread, and withal she saw herself so little and
so low, so simple and so poor, in regard of<a name="FNanchor_1_69" id="FNanchor_1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_69" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> her Lord
God, that this reverent dread fulfilled her with meekness.
And thus, by this ground [of meekness] she was
fulfilled with grace and with all manner of virtues, and
overpasseth all creatures.</p>

<p>In all the time that He shewed this that I have told
now in spiritual sight, I saw the bodily sight lasting of
the plenteous bleeding of the Head. The great drops
of blood fell down from under the Garland like pellots,
seeming as it had come out of the veins; and in the
coming out they were brown-red, for the blood was full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
thick; and in the spreading-abroad they were bright-red;
and when they came to the brows, then they
vanished; notwithstanding, the bleeding continued till
many things were seen and understood. The fairness
and the lifelikeness is like nothing but the same; the
plenteousness is like to the drops of water that fall off
the eaves after a great shower of rain, that fall so thick
that no man may number them with bodily wit; and for
the roundness, they were like to the scale of herring, in
the spreading on the forehead. These three came to
my mind in the time: pellots, for roundness, in the
coming out of the blood; the scale of herring, in the
spreading in the forehead, for roundness; the drops off
eaves, for the plenteousness innumerable.</p>

<p>This Shewing was quick and life-like, and horrifying
and dreadful, sweet and lovely. And of all the sight it
was most comfort to me that our God and Lord that is
so reverend and dreadful, is so homely and courteous:
and this most fulfilled me with comfort and assuredness
of soul.</p>

<p>And to the understanding of this He shewed this
open example:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is the most worship that a solemn King or a great
Lord may do a poor servant if he will be homely with
him, and specially if he sheweth it <i>himself</i>, of a full true
meaning, and with a glad cheer, both privately and in
company. Then thinketh this poor creature thus: <i>And
what might this noble Lord do of more worship and joy to me
than to shew me that am so simple this marvellous homeliness?
Soothly it is more joy and pleasance to me than [if] he gave me
great gifts and were himself strange in manner.</i></p>

<p>This bodily example was shewed so highly that man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
heart might be ravished and almost forgetting itself for
joy of the great homeliness. Thus it fareth with our
Lord Jesus and with us. For verily it is the most joy
that may be, as to my sight, that He that is highest and
mightiest, noblest and worthiest, is lowest and meekest,
homeliest and most courteous: and truly and verily this
marvellous joy shall be shewn us all when we see
Him.</p>

<p>And this willeth our Lord that we seek for and trust
to, joy and delight in, comforting us and solacing us, as
we may with His grace and with His help, unto the
time that we see it verily. For the most fulness of joy
that we shall have, as to my sight, is the marvellous
courtesy and homeliness of our Father, that is our Maker,
in our Lord Jesus Christ that is our Brother and our
Saviour.</p>

<p>But this marvellous homeliness may no man fully see
in this time of life, save he have it of special shewing of
our Lord, or of great plenty of grace inwardly given
of the Holy Ghost. But faith and belief with charity
deserveth the meed: and so it is had, by grace; for in
faith, with hope and charity, our life is grounded. The
Shewing, made to whom that God will, plainly teacheth
the same, opened and declared, with many privy points
belonging to our Faith which be worshipful to know.
And when the Shewing which is given in a time is
passed and hid, then the faith keepeth [it] by grace of
the Holy Ghost unto our life's end. And thus through
the Shewing it is not other than of faith, nor less nor
more; as it may be seen in our Lord's teaching in the
same matter, by that time that it shall come to the
end.</p>

these words: <i>Benedicite Domine!</i></p>

fair and good; but the cause why it shewed so little to

the Maker of all, all that is made seemeth full little.&mdash;The
fifth is: He that made all things for love, by the

stinted,<a name="FNanchor_3_72" id="FNanchor_3_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_72" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but the spiritual sight dwelled in mine understanding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and I abode with reverent dread, joying in
that I saw. And I desired, as I durst, to see more, if
it were His will, or else [to see for] longer time the
same.</p>

<p>In all this I was greatly stirred in charity to mine
even-Christians, that they might see and know the same
that I saw: for I would it were comfort to them. For
all this Sight was shewed [with] general [regard]. Then
said I to them that were about me: <i>It is to-day Doomsday
with me</i>. And this I said for that I thought to have died.
(For that day that a man dieth, he is judged<a name="FNanchor_4_73" id="FNanchor_4_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_73" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as shall be
without end, as to mine understanding.) This I said for
that I would they might love God the better, for to
make them to have in mind that this life is short, as they
might see in example. For in all this time I weened to
have died; and that was marvel to me, and troublous
partly: for methought this Vision was shewed for them
that should live. And that which I say of me, I say in
the person of all mine even-Christians: for I am taught
in the Spiritual Shewing of our Lord God that He
meaneth so. And therefore I pray you all for God's
sake, and counsel you for your own profit, that ye leave
the beholding of a poor creature<a name="FNanchor_5_74" id="FNanchor_5_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_74" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that it was shewed to,
and mightily, wisely, and meekly behold God that of
His courteous love and endless goodness would shew it
generally, in comfort of us all. For it is God's will
that ye take it with great joy and pleasance, as if Jesus
had shewed it to you all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"If I look singularly to myself, I am right nought"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Because of the Shewing I am not good but if I love
God the better: and in as much as ye love God
the better, it is more to you than to me. I say<a name="FNanchor_1_75" id="FNanchor_1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_75" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> not
this to them that be wise, for they wot it well; but I
say it to you that be simple, for ease and comfort: for
we are all one in comfort. For truly it was not shewed
me that God loved me better than the least soul that is
in grace; for I am certain that there be many that never
had Shewing nor sight but of the common teaching of
Holy Church, that love God better than I. For if I
look singularly to myself, I am right nought; but in
[the] general [Body] I am, I hope, in oneness of charity
with all mine even-Christians.</p>

<p>For in this oneness standeth the life of all mankind
that shall be saved. For God is all that is good, as to
my sight, and God hath made all that is made, and
God loveth all that He hath made: and he that loveth
generally all his even-Christians for God, he loveth all
that is. For in mankind that shall be saved is comprehended
all: that is to say, all that is made and the
Maker of all. For in man is God, and God is in all.
And I hope by the grace of God he that beholdeth it
thus shall be truly taught and mightily comforted, if he
needeth comfort.</p>

<p>I speak of them that shall be saved, for in this time
God shewed me none other. But in all things I believe
as Holy Church believeth, preacheth, and teacheth. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the Faith of Holy Church, the which I had aforehand
understood and, as I hope, by the grace of God earnestly
kept in use and custom, stood continually in my sight:
[I] willing and meaning never to receive anything that
might be contrary thereunto. And with this intent I
beheld the Shewing with all my diligence: for in all this
blessed Shewing I beheld it as one in God's meaning.<a name="FNanchor_2_76" id="FNanchor_2_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_76" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>All this was shewed by three [ways]: that is to say,
by bodily sight, and by word formed in mine understanding,
and by spiritual sight. But the spiritual sight
I cannot nor may not shew it as openly nor as fully as I
would. But I trust in our Lord God Almighty that He
shall of His goodness, and for your love, make you to
take it more spiritually and more sweetly than I can or
may tell it.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SECOND_REVELATION" id="THE_SECOND_REVELATION"><i>THE SECOND REVELATION</i></a></h3>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"God willeth to be seen and to be sought: to be abided
and to be trusted"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And after this I saw with bodily sight in the face of
the crucifix that hung before me, on the which I
gazed continually, a part of His Passion: despite,
spitting and sullying, and buffetting, and many languoring
pains, more than I can tell, and often changing of
colour. And one time I saw half the face, beginning at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the ear, over-gone with dry blood till it covered to the
mid-face. And after that the other half [was] covered on
the same wise, the whiles in this [first] part [it vanished]
even as it came.</p>

<p>This saw I bodily, troublously and darkly; and I
desired more bodily sight, to have seen more clearly.
And I was answered in my reason: <i>If God will shew thee
more, He shall be thy light: thee needeth none but Him.</i> For
I saw Him sought.<a name="FNanchor_1_77" id="FNanchor_1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_77" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>For we are now so blind and unwise that we never
seek God till He of His goodness shew Himself to us.
And when we aught see of Him graciously, then are we
stirred by the same grace to seek with great desire to see
Him more blissfully.</p>

<p>And thus I saw Him, and sought Him; and I had
Him, I wanted Him. And this is, and should be, our
common working in this [life], as to my sight.</p>

<p>One time mine understanding was led down into the
sea-ground, and there I saw hills and dales green,
seeming as it were moss-be-grown, with wrack and
gravel. Then I understood thus: that if a man or
woman were under the broad water, if he might have
sight of God so as God is with a man continually, he
should be safe in body and soul, and take no harm: and
overpassing, he should have more solace and comfort
than all this world can tell. For He willeth we should
believe that we see Him continually though that to us it
seemeth but little [of sight]; and in this belief He
maketh us evermore to gain grace. For He will be seen
and He will be sought: He will be abided and he will
be trusted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>This Second Shewing was so low and so little and so
simple, that my spirits were in great travail in the beholding,&mdash;mourning,
full of dread, and longing: for I was
some time in doubt whether it was a Shewing. And then
diverse times our good Lord gave me more sight,
whereby I understood truly that it was a Shewing. It
was a figure and likeness of our foul deeds' shame that
our fair, bright, blessed Lord bare for our sins: it made
me to think of the Holy Vernacle<a name="FNanchor_2_78" id="FNanchor_2_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_78" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at Rome, which He
hath portrayed with His own blessed face when He was
in His hard Passion, with steadfast will going to His
death, and often changing of colour. Of the brownness
and blackness, the ruefulness and wastedness of this
Image many marvel how it might be, since that He portrayed
it with His blessed Face who is the fairness of
heaven, flower of earth, and the fruit of the Maiden's
womb. Then how might this Image be so darkening in
colour<a name="FNanchor_3_79" id="FNanchor_3_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_79" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and so far from fair?&mdash;I desire to tell like as I
have understood by the grace of God:&mdash;</p>

<p>We know in our Faith, and believe by the teaching
and preaching of Holy Church, that the blessed Trinity
made Mankind to<a name="FNanchor_4_80" id="FNanchor_4_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_80" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His image and to His likeness. In
the same manner-wise we know that when man fell so
deep and so wretchedly by sin, there was none other
help to restore man but through Him that made man.
And He that made man for love, by the same love He
would restore man to the same bliss, and overpassing;
and like as we were like-made to the Trinity in our first
making, our Maker would that we should be like Jesus
Christ, Our Saviour, in heaven without end, by the
virtue of our again-making.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>Then atwix these two, He would for love and worship
of man make Himself as like to man in this deadly
life, in our foulness and our wretchedness, as man might
be without guilt. This is that which is meant where it
is said afore: it was the image and likeness of our foul
black deeds' shame wherein our fair, bright, blessed
Lord God was hid. But full certainly I dare say, and
we ought to trow it, that so fair a man was never none
but He, till what time His fair colour was changed with
travail and sorrow and Passion and dying. Of this it is
spoken in the Eighth Revelation, where it treateth more
of the same likeness. And where it speaketh of the
Vernacle of Rome, it meaneth by [reason of] diverse
changing of colour and countenance, sometime more
comfortably and life-like, sometime more ruefully and
death-like, as it may be seen in the Eighth Revelation.</p>

<p>And this [dim] vision was a learning, to mine understanding,
that the continual seeking of the soul pleaseth
God full greatly: for it may do no more than seek, suffer
and trust. And this is wrought in the soul that hath it,
by the Holy Ghost; and the clearness of finding, <i>it</i> is of
His special grace, when it is His will. The seeking,
with faith, hope, and charity, pleaseth our Lord, and the
finding pleaseth the soul and fulfilleth it with joy. And
thus was I learned, to mine understanding, that seeking
is as good as beholding, for the time that He will suffer
the soul to be in travail. It is God's will that <i>we seek
Him</i>, to the beholding of Him, for by <i>that</i><a name="FNanchor_5_81" id="FNanchor_5_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_81" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He shall shew
us Himself of His special grace when He will. And
how a soul shall have Him in its beholding, He shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
teach Himself: and that is most worship to Him and
profit to thyself, and [the soul thus] most receiveth of
meekness and virtues with the grace and leading of the
Holy Ghost. For a soul that only fasteneth it[self] on
to God with very trust, either by seeking or in beholding,
it is the most worship that it may do to Him, as to my
sight.</p>

<p>These are two workings that may be seen in this
Vision: the one is seeking, the other is beholding. The
seeking is common,&mdash;that every soul may have with His
grace,&mdash;and ought to have that discretion and teaching
of the Holy Church. It is God's will that we have
three things in our seeking:&mdash;The first is that we seek
earnestly and diligently, without sloth, and, as it may be
through His grace, without unreasonable<a name="FNanchor_6_82" id="FNanchor_6_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_82" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> heaviness and
vain sorrow. The second is, that we abide Him steadfastly
for His love, without murmuring and striving
against Him, to our life's end: for it shall last but awhile.
The third is that we trust in Him mightily of full assured
faith. For it is His will that we know that He shall
appear suddenly and blissfully to all that love Him.</p>

<p>For His working is privy, and He willeth to be perceived;
and His appearing shall be swiftly sudden; and
He willeth to be trusted. For He is full gracious<a name="FNanchor_7_83" id="FNanchor_7_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_83" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
homely: Blessed may He be!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"All thing that is done, it is well done: for our Lord God
doeth all." "Sin is no deed"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And after this I saw God in a Point,<a name="FNanchor_1_84" id="FNanchor_1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_84" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that is to say,
in mine understanding,&mdash;by which sight I saw
that He is in all things.</p>

<p>I beheld and considered, seeing and knowing in sight,
with a soft dread, and thought: <i>What is sin?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>For I saw truly that God doeth all-thing, be it never
so little. And I saw truly that nothing is done by hap
nor by adventure, but all things by the foreseeing
wisdom of God: if it be hap or adventure in the sight
of man, our blindness and our unforesight is the cause.
For the things that are in the foreseeing wisdom of God
from without beginning, (which rightfully and worshipfully
and continually He leadeth to the best end,) as they
come about fall to us suddenly, ourselves unwitting;
and thus by our blindness and our unforesight we say:
these be haps and adventures. But to our Lord God
they be not so.</p>

<p>Wherefore me behoveth needs to grant that all-thing
that is done, it is well-done: for our Lord God doeth
all. For in this time the working of creatures was not
shewed, but [the working] of our Lord God in the
creature: for He is in the Mid-point of all thing, and all
He doeth. And I was certain He doeth no sin.</p>

<p>And here I saw verily that sin is no deed: for in all
this was not sin shewed. And I would no longer marvel
in this, but beheld our Lord, what He would shew.</p>

<p>And thus, as much as it might be for the time, the
rightfulness of God's working was shewed to the soul.</p>

<p>Rightfulness hath two fair properties: it is right and
it is full. And so are all the works of our Lord God:
thereto needeth neither the working of mercy nor grace:
for they be all rightful: wherein faileth nought.</p>

<p>But in another time He gave a Shewing for the beholding
of sin nakedly, as I shall tell: where He useth
working of mercy and grace.</p>

<p>And this vision was shewed, to mine understanding,
for that our Lord would have the soul turned truly unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the beholding of Him, and generally of all His works.
For they are full good; and all His doings are easy and
sweet, and to great ease bringing the soul that is turned
from the beholding of the blind Deeming of man unto
the fair sweet Deeming of our Lord God. For a man
beholdeth some deeds well done and some deeds evil,
but our Lord beholdeth them not so: for as all that hath
being in nature is of Godly making, so is all that is done,
in property of God's doing. For it is easy to understand
that the best deed is well done: and so well as the best
deed is done&mdash;the highest&mdash;so well is the least deed
done; and all thing in its property and in the order that
our Lord hath ordained it to from without beginning.
For there is no doer but He.</p>

<p>I saw full surely that he changeth never His purpose
in no manner of thing, nor never shall, without end.
For there was no thing unknown to Him in His rightful
ordinance from without beginning. And therefore all-thing
was set in order ere anything was made, as it
should stand without end; and no manner of thing shall
fail of that point. For He made all things in fulness of
goodness, and therefore the blessed Trinity is ever full
pleased in all His works.<a name="FNanchor_2_85" id="FNanchor_2_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_85" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>And all this shewed He full blissfully, signifying thus:
<i>See! I am God: see! I am in all thing: see! I do all thing:
see! I lift never mine hands off my works, nor ever shall,
without end: see! I lead all thing to the end I ordained it
to from without beginning, by the same Might, Wisdom and
Love whereby I made it. How should any thing be amiss?</i></p>

<p>Thus mightily, wisely, and lovingly was the soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
examined in this Vision. Then saw I soothly that me
behoved, of need, to assent, with great reverence enjoying
in God.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_84" id="Footnote_1_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_84"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See below: "He is in the Mid-point," and lxiii. p. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>, "the blessed
Point from which nature came: that is, God." See also xxi. p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>,

the <i>Banquet of Dante Alighieri</i>, tr. by K. Hillard (Kegan
Paul, Trench &amp; Co.), Bk. II. xiv. 12, "<i>Geometry moves between the print
and the circle</i>"; as Euclid says, "the point is the beginning of Geometry,
and according to him, the circle is the most perfect figure, and therefore
may be considered its end.... The point by reason of its indivisibility
is immeasurable, and the circle by reason of its arc cannot be exactly
squared, and therefore cannot be measured with precision." Notes by
Miss Hillard: "This is why the Deity is represented by a <i>point. Paradiso</i>,
xxviii. 16: 'A point beheld I,' 'Heaven and all nature, hangs
upon that point,' etc. Bk. IV. 6, quoting Aristotle's <i>Physics</i>: '<i>The
circle can be called perfect when it is a true circle.</i> And this is when
it contains a point which is equally distant from every part of its
circumference.' In the <i>Vita Nuova</i> Love appearing, says&mdash;'I am as
the centre of a circle, to which all parts of the circumference bear
an equal relation' ('<i>Amor che muove il sole e l'altre stelle</i>')." From
<i>Neoplatonism</i>, by C. Bigg, D.D. (S.P.C.K.), p. 122: "Thus we get
a triplet&mdash;Soul, Intelligence, and a higher Intelligence. The last is
spoken of as One, as a point, as neither good nor evil because above
both."</p></div>

<p>And after this I saw, beholding, the body plenteously
bleeding in seeming of<a name="FNanchor_1_86" id="FNanchor_1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_86" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Scourging, as thus:&mdash;The
fair skin was broken full deep into the tender flesh
with sharp smiting all about the sweet body. So
plenteously the hot blood ran out that there was neither
seen skin nor wound, but as it were all blood. And
when it came where it should have fallen down, then it
vanished. Notwithstanding, the bleeding continued
awhile: till it might be seen and considered.<a name="FNanchor_2_87" id="FNanchor_2_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_87" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And
this was so plenteous, to my sight, that methought if

should have made the bed all one blood, and have passed
over about.</p>

<p>And then came to my mind that God hath made waters
plenteous in earth to our service and to our bodily ease
for tender love that He hath to us, but yet liketh
Him better that we take full homely His blessed blood
to wash us of sin: for there is no water<a name="FNanchor_4_89" id="FNanchor_4_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_89" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that is made
that He liketh so well to give us. For it is most plenteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
as it is most precious: and that by the virtue of His

belongeth to us by the virtue of His precious love.</p>

<p>The dearworthy blood of our Lord Jesus Christ as
verily as it is most precious, so verily it is most plenteous.
Behold and see! The precious plenty of His dearworthy

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"The Enemy is overcome by the blessed Passion and Death
of our Lord Jesus Christ"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And after this, ere God shewed any words, He
suffered me for a convenient time to give heed
unto Him and all that I had seen, and all intellect<a name="FNanchor_1_91" id="FNanchor_1_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_91" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
was therein, as the simplicity of the soul might take it.<a name="FNanchor_2_92" id="FNanchor_2_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_92" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Then He, without voice and opening of lips, formed in
my soul these words: <i>Herewith is the Fiend overcome</i>.
These words said our Lord, meaning His blessed
Passion as He shewed it afore.</p>

<p>On this shewed our Lord that the Passion of Him is
the overcoming of the Fiend. God shewed that the
Fiend hath now the same malice that he had afore the
Incarnation. And as sore he travaileth, and as continually
he seeth that all souls of salvation escape him, worshipfully,
by the virtue of Christ's precious Passion. And
that is his sorrow, and full evil is he ashamed: for all
that God suffereth him to do turneth [for] us to joy and
[for] him to shame and woe. And he hath as much
sorrow when God giveth him leave to work, as when he
worketh not: and that is for that he may never do as
ill as he would: for his might is all taken<a name="FNanchor_3_93" id="FNanchor_3_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_93" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> into God's
hand.</p>

<p>But in God there may be no wrath, as to my sight:
for our good Lord endlessly hath regard to His own
worship and to the profit of all that shall be saved. With
might and right He withstandeth the Reproved, the
which of malice and wickedness busy them to contrive
and to do against God's will. Also I saw our Lord
scorn his malice and set at nought his unmight; and He
willeth that we do so. For this sight I laughed mightily,
and that made them to laugh that were about me, and
their laughing was a pleasure to me. I thought that I
would that all mine even-Christians had seen as I saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and then would they all laugh with me. But I saw not
Christ laugh. For I understood that we may laugh in
comforting of ourselves and joying in God for that the
devil is overcome. And when I saw Him scorn his
malice, it was by leading of mine understanding into our
Lord: that is to say, it was an inward shewing of
verity, without changing of look.<a name="FNanchor_4_94" id="FNanchor_4_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_94" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> For, as to my sight,
it is a worshipful property of God's that [He] is ever the
same.</p>

<p>And after this I fell into a graveness,<a name="FNanchor_5_95" id="FNanchor_5_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_95" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and said: <i>I see
three things: I see game, scorn, and earnest. I see [a] game,
in that the Fiend is overcome; I see scorn, in that God scorneth
him, and he shall be scorned; and I see earnest, in that he is
overcome by the blissful Passion and Death of our Lord Jesus
Christ that was done in full earnest and with sober travail.</i></p>

<p>When I said, <i>he is scorned</i>,&mdash;I meant that God scorneth
him, that is to say, because He seeth him now as he shall
do without end. For in this [word] God shewed that
the Fiend is condemned. And this meant I when I said:
<i>he shall be scorned</i>: [he shall be scorned] at Doomsday,
generally of all that shall be saved, to whose consolation
he hath great ill-will.<a name="FNanchor_6_96" id="FNanchor_6_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_96" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> For then he shall see that all the
woe and tribulation that he hath done to them shall be
turned to increase of their joy, without end; and all the
pain and tribulation that he would have brought them to
shall endlessly go with him to hell.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"The age of every man shall be acknowledged before him in
Heaven, and every man shall be rewarded for his willing service
and for his time"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>After this our good Lord said: <i>I thank thee for thy
travail, and especially for thy youth.</i></p>

<p>And in this [Shewing] mine understanding was lifted
up into Heaven where I saw our Lord as a lord in his
own house, which hath called all his dear worthy servants
and friends to a stately<a name="FNanchor_1_97" id="FNanchor_1_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_97" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> feast. Then I saw the Lord
take no place in His own house, but I saw Him royally
reign in His house, fulfilling it with joy and mirth,
Himself endlessly to gladden and to solace His dearworthy
friends, full homely and full courteously, with
marvellous melody of endless love, in His own fair
blessed Countenance. Which glorious Countenance of
the Godhead fulfilleth the Heavens with joy and bliss.<a name="FNanchor_2_98" id="FNanchor_2_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_98" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>God shewed three degrees of bliss that every soul
shall have in Heaven that willingly hath served God in
any degree in earth. The first is the worshipful thanks
of our Lord God that he shall receive when he is delivered
of pain. This thanking is so high and so worshipful
that the soul thinketh it filleth him though there
were no more. For methought that all the pain and
travail that might be suffered by all living men might
not deserve the worshipful thanks that one man shall
have that willingly hath served God. The second is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
that all the blessed creatures that are in Heaven shall
see that worshipful thanking, and He maketh his service
known to all that are in Heaven. And here this example
was shewed:&mdash;A king, if he thank his servants, it is a
great worship to them, and if he maketh it known to all
the realm, then is the worship greatly increased.&mdash;The
third is, that as new and as gladdening as it is received
in that time, right so shall it last without end.</p>

<p>And I saw that homely and sweetly was this shewed,
and that the age of every man shall be [made] known in
Heaven, and [he] shall be rewarded for his willing
service and for his time. And specially the age of them
that willingly and freely offer their youth unto God,
passingly is rewarded and wonderfully is thanked.</p>

<p>For I saw that whene'er what time a man or woman is
truly turned to God,&mdash;for one day's service and for his
endless will he shall have all these three decrees of bliss.
And the more the loving soul seeth this courtesy of
God, the liefer he<a name="FNanchor_3_99" id="FNanchor_3_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_99" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is to serve him all the days of his
life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"It is not God's will that we follow the feeling of pains in
sorrow and mourning for them"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And after this He shewed a sovereign ghostly pleasante
in my soul. I was fulfilled with the everlasting
sureness, mightily sustained without any painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
dread. This feeling was so glad and so ghostly that
I was in all peace and in rest, that there was nothing
in earth that should have grieved me.</p>

<p>This lasted but a while, and I was turned and left to
myself in heaviness, and weariness of my life, and irksomeness
of myself, that scarcely I could have patience
to live. There was no comfort nor none ease to me but
faith, hope, and charity; and these I had in truth, but
little in feeling.</p>

<p>And anon after this our blessed Lord gave me again
the comfort and the rest in soul, in satisfying and sureness
so blissful and so mighty that no dread, no sorrow,
no pain bodily that might be suffered should have distressed
me. And then the pain shewed again to my
feeling, and then the joy and the pleasing, and now that
one, and now that other, divers times&mdash;I suppose about
twenty times. And in the time of joy I might have
said with Saint Paul: <i>Nothing shall dispart me from the
charity of Christ</i>; and in the pain I might have said with
Peter: <i>Lord, save me: I perish!</i></p>

<p>This Vision was shewed me, according to mine understanding,
[for] that it is speedful to some souls to feel
on this wise: sometime to be in comfort, and sometime
to fail and to be left to themselves. God willeth that
we know that He keepeth us even alike secure in woe
and in weal. And for profit of man's soul, a man is
sometime left to himself; although sin is not always the
cause: for in this time I sinned not wherefore I should
be left to myself&mdash;for it was so sudden. Also I deserved
not to have this blessed feeling. But freely our Lord
giveth when He will; and suffereth us [to be] in woe
sometime. And both is one love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>For it is God's will that we hold us in comfort with
all our might: for bliss is lasting without end, and pain
is passing and shall be brought to nought for them that
shall be saved. And therefore it is not God's will that
we follow the feelings of pain in sorrow and mourning
for them, but that we suddenly pass over, and hold us
in endless enjoyment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"A Part of His Passion"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>After this Christ shewed a part of His Passion near
His dying.</p>

<p>I saw His sweet face as it were dry and bloodless
with pale dying. And later, more pale, dead, languoring;
and then turned more dead unto blue; and then more
brown-blue, as the flesh turned more deeply dead. For
His Passion shewed to me most specially in His blessed
face (and chiefly in His lips): there I saw these four
colours, though it were afore fresh, ruddy, and pleasing,
to my sight. This was a pitiful change to see, this deep
dying. And also the [inward] moisture clotted and
dried, to my sight, and the sweet body was brown and
black, all turned out of fair, life-like colour of itself,
unto dry dying.</p>

<p>For that same time that our Lord and blessed Saviour
died upon the Rood, it was a dry, hard wind, and
wondrous cold, as to my sight, and what time [all] the
precious blood was bled out of the sweet body that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
might pass therefrom, yet there dwelled a moisture in
the sweet flesh of Christ, as it was shewed.</p>

<p>Bloodlessness and pain dried within; and blowing of
wind and cold coming from without met together in the
sweet body of Christ. And these four,&mdash;twain without,
and twain within&mdash;dried the flesh of Christ by process of
time. And though this pain was bitter and sharp, it was
full long lasting, as to my sight, and painfully dried up
all the lively spirits of Christ's flesh. Thus I saw the
sweet flesh dry in seeming by part after part, with
marvellous pains. And as long as any spirit had life in
Christ's flesh, so long suffered He pain.</p>

<p>This long pining seemed to me as if He had been
seven nights dead, dying, at the point of outpassing away,
suffering the last pain. And when I said it seemed to
me as if He had been seven night dead, it meaneth that
the sweet body was so discoloured, so dry, so shrunken,
so deathly, and so piteous, as if He had been seven night
dead, continually dying. And methought the drying of
Christ's flesh was the most pain, and the last, of His
Passion.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"How might any pain be more to me than to see Him that is
all my life, and all my bliss, and all my joy suffer?"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And in this dying was brought to my mind the words
of Christ: <i>I thirst</i>.</p>

<p>For I saw in Christ a double thirst: one bodily;
another spiritual, the which I shall speak of in the
Thirty-first Chapter.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>For this word was shewed for the bodily thirst: the
which I understood was caused by failing of moisture.
For the blessed flesh and bones was left all alone without
blood and moisture. The blessed body dried alone
long time with wringing of the nails and weight of the
body. For I understood that for tenderness of the sweet
hands and of the sweet feet, by the greatness, hardness,
and grievousness of the nails the wounds waxed wide
and the body sagged, for weight by long time hanging.
And [therewith was] piercing and pressing of the head,
and binding of the Crown all baked with dry blood,
with the sweet hair clinging, and the dry flesh, to the
thorns, and the thorns to the flesh drying; and in the
beginning while the flesh was fresh and bleeding, the
continual sitting of the thorns made the wounds wide.
And furthermore I saw that the sweet skin and the
tender flesh, with the hair and the blood, was all raised
and loosed about from the bone, with the thorns where-through
it were rent in many pieces, as a cloth that were
sagging, as if it would hastily have fallen off, for heaviness
and looseness, while it had natural moisture. And
that was great sorrow and dread to me: for methought
I would not for my life have seen it fall. How it was
done I saw not; but understood it was with the sharp
thorns and the violent and grievous setting on of the
Garland of Thorns, unsparingly and without pity.
This continued awhile, and soon it began to change,
and I beheld and marvelled how it might be. And then
I saw it was because it began to dry, and stint a part of
the weight, and set about the Garland. And thus
it encircled all about, as it were garland upon garland.
The Garland of the Thorns was dyed with the blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and that other garland [of Blood] and the head, all was
one colour, as clotted blood when it is dry. The skin
of the flesh that shewed (of the face and of the body),
was small-rimpled<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with a tanned colour, like a dry
board when it is aged; and the face more brown than
the body.</p>

<p>I saw four manner of dryings: the first was bloodlessness;
the second was pain following after; the third,
hanging up in the air, as men hang a cloth to dry; the
fourth, that the bodily Kind asked liquid and there was
no manner of comfort ministered to Him in all His woe
and distress. Ah! hard and grievous was his pain, but
much more hard and grievous it was when the moisture
failed and began to dry thus, shrivelling.</p>

<p>These were the pains that shewed in the blessed head:
the first wrought to the dying, while it had moisture;
and that other, slow, with shrinking drying, [and] with
blowing of the wind from without, that dried and pained
Him with cold more than mine heart can think.</p>

<p>And other pains&mdash;for which pains I saw that all is
too little that I can say: for it may not be told.</p>

<p>The which Shewing of Christ's pains filled me full of
pain. For I wist well He suffered but once, but [this
was as if] He would shew it me and fill me with mind
as I had afore desired. And in all this time of Christ's
pains I felt no pain but for Christ's pains. Then thought-me:
<i>I knew but little what pain it was that I asked</i>; and,
as a wretch, repented me, thinking: <i>If I had wist what
it had been, loth me had been to have prayed it</i>. For methought
it passed bodily death, my pains.</p>

<p>I thought: <i>Is any pain like this?</i> And I was answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in my reason: <i>Hell is another pain: for there is despair.
But of all pains that lead to salvation this is the most pain, to
see thy Love suffer. How might any pain be more to me than
to see Him that is all my life, all my bliss, and all my joy,
suffer?</i> Here felt I soothfastly<a name="FNanchor_2_101" id="FNanchor_2_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_101" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that I loved Christ so
much above myself that there was no pain that might be
suffered like to that sorrow that I had to [see] Him in
pain.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"When He was in pain, we were in pain"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Here I saw a part of the compassion of our Lady,
Saint Mary: for Christ and she were so oned in
love that the greatness of her loving was cause of the
greatness of her pain. For in this [Shewing] I saw a
Substance of Nature's<a name="FNanchor_1_102" id="FNanchor_1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_102" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Love, continued by Grace, that
creatures have to Him: which Kind Love was most fully
shewed in His sweet Mother, and overpassing; for so
much as she loved Him more than all other, her pains
passed all other. For ever the higher, the mightier, the
sweeter that the love be, the more sorrow it is to the
lover to see that body in pain that is loved.</p>

<p>And all His disciples and all His true lovers suffered
pains more than their own bodily dying. For I am sure
by mine own feeling that the least of them loved Him
so far above himself that it passeth all that I can say.</p>

<p>Here saw I a great oneing betwixt Christ and us, to
mine understanding: for when He was in pain, we were
in pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>And all creatures that ought suffer pain, suffered with
Him: that is to say, all creatures that God hath made
to our service. The firmament, the earth, failed for
sorrow in their Nature in the time of Christ's dying. For
it belongeth naturally to their property to know Him for
their God, in whom all their virtue standeth: when He
failed, then behoved it needs to them, because of kindness
[between them], to fail with Him, as much as they
might, for sorrow of His pains.</p>

<p>And thus they that were His friends suffered pain for
love. And, generally, <i>all</i>: that is to say, they that knew
Him not suffered for failing of all manner of comfort
save the mighty, privy keeping of God. I speak of two
manner of folk, as they may be understood by two persons:
the one was Pilate, the other was Saint Dionyse<a name="FNanchor_2_103" id="FNanchor_2_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_103" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
of France, which was [at] that time a Paynim. For
when he saw wondrous and marvellous sorrows and
dreads that befell in that time, he said: <i>Either the world
is now at an end, or He that is Maker of Kind suffereth.</i>
Wherefore he did write on an altar: <span class="smcap">This is the Altar
of Unknown God</span>. God that of His goodness maketh
the planets and the elements to work of Kind to the
blessed man and the cursed, in that time made withdrawing<a name="FNanchor_3_104" id="FNanchor_3_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_104" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
of it from both; wherefore it was that they that
knew Him not were in sorrow that time.</p>

<p>Thus was our Lord Jesus made-naught for us; and
all we stand in this manner made-naught with Him, and
shall do till we come to His bliss; as I shall tell after.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"Thus was I learned to choose Jesus for my Heaven, whom I
saw only in pain at that time"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>In this [time] I would have looked up from the Cross,
but I durst not. For I wist well that while I beheld
in the Cross I was surely-safe; therefore I would not
assent to put my soul in peril: for away from the Cross
was no sureness, for frighting of fiends.</p>

<p>Then had I a proffer in my reason,<a name="FNanchor_1_105" id="FNanchor_1_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_105" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as if it had been
friendly said to me: <i>Look up to Heaven to His Father</i>.
And then saw I well, with the faith that I felt, that
there was nothing betwixt the Cross and Heaven that
might have harmed me. Either me behoved to look up
or else to answer. I answered inwardly with all the
might of my soul, and said: <i>Nay; I may not: for Thou
art my Heaven.</i> This I said for that I would not. For
I would liever have been in that pain till Doomsday than
to come to Heaven otherwise than by Him. For I wist
well that He that bound me so sore, He should unbind
me when that He would. Thus was I learned to choose
Jesus to my Heaven, whom I saw only in pain at that
time: meliked no other Heaven than Jesus, which shall
be my bliss when I come there.</p>

<p>And this hath ever been a comfort to me, that I chose
Jesus to my Heaven, by His grace, in all this time of
Passion and sorrow; and that hath been a learning to
me that I should evermore do so: choose only Jesus
to my Heaven in weal and woe.</p>

<p>And though I as a wretched creature had repented me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
(I said afore if I had wist what pain it would be, I had
been loth to have prayed), here saw I truly that it was
reluctance and frailty of the flesh without assent of the
soul: to which God assigneth no blame. Repenting
and willing choice be two contraries which I felt both
in one at that time. And these be [of our] two parts:
the one outward, the other inward. The outward part
is our deadly flesh-hood, which is now in pain and woe,
and shall be, in this life: whereof I felt much in this
time; and that part it was that repented. The inward
part is an high, blissful life, which is all in peace and in
love: and this was more inwardly felt; and this part is
[that] in which mightily, wisely and with steadfast will
I chose Jesus to my Heaven.</p>

<p>And in this I saw verily that the inward part is master
and sovereign to the outward, and doth not charge itself
with, nor take heed to, the will of that: but all the
intent and will is set to be oned unto our Lord Jesus.
That the outward part should draw the inward to assent
was not shewed to me; but that the inward draweth the
outward by grace, and both shall be oned in bliss without
end, by the virtue of Christ,&mdash;<i>this</i> was shewed.</p>

<p>And thus I saw our Lord Jesus languoring long
time. For the oneing with the Godhead gave
strength to the manhood for love to suffer more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
all men might suffer: I mean not only more pain than
all men might suffer, but also that He suffered more pain
than all men of salvation that ever were from the first
beginning unto the last day might tell or fully think,
having regard to the worthiness of the highest worshipful
King and the shameful, despised, painful death. For
He that is highest and worthiest was most fully made-nought
and most utterly despised.</p>

<p>For the highest point that may be seen in the Passion
is to think and know what He is that suffered. And in
this [Shewing] He brought in part to mind the height
and nobleness of the glorious Godhead, and therewith
the preciousness and the tenderness of the blessed Body,
which be together united; and also the lothness that is
in our Kind to suffer pain. For as much as He was
most tender and pure, right so He was most strong and
mighty to suffer.</p>

<p>And for every man's sin that shall be saved He suffered:
and every man's sorrow and desolation He saw, and
sorrowed for Blindness and love. (For in as much as
our Lady sorrowed for His pains, in so much He suffered
sorrow for her sorrow;&mdash;and more, in as greatly as the
sweet manhood of Him was worthier in Kind.) For as
long as He was passible He suffered for us and sorrowed
<i>for</i> us; and now He is uprisen and no more passible, yet
He suffereth <i>with</i> us.</p>

<p>And I, beholding all this by His grace, saw that the
Love of Him was so strong which He hath to our soul
that willingly He chose it with great desire, and mildly
He suffered it with well-pleasing.</p>

<p>For the soul that beholdeth it thus, when it is touched
by grace, it shall verily see that the pains of Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>

shall be turned into everlasting, o'erpassing joys by the

<br /></p>


<p>It is God's will, as to mine understanding, that we
have Three<a name="FNanchor_1_106" id="FNanchor_1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_106" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Manners of Beholding His blessed
Passion. The First is: <i>the hard Pain that He suffered</i>,&mdash;[beholding
it] with contrition and compassion. And that
shewed our Lord in this time, and gave me strength and
grace to see it.</p>

<p>And I looked for the departing with all my might, and
thought to have seen the body all dead; but I saw Him
not so. And right in the same time that methought, by
the seeming, the life might no longer last and the Shewing
of the end behoved needs to be,&mdash;suddenly (I
beholding in the same Cross), He changed [the look of]
His blessed Countenance.<a name="FNanchor_2_107" id="FNanchor_2_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_107" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The changing of His blessed
Countenance changed mine, and I was as glad and merry
as it was possible. Then brought our Lord merrily to
my mind: <i>Where is now any point of the pain, or of thy grief?</i>
And I was full merry.</p>

<p>I understood that we be now, in our Lord's meaning,
in His Cross with Him in His pains and His Passion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
dying; and we, willingly abiding in the same Cross with
His help and His grace unto the last point, suddenly He
shall change His Cheer to us, and we shall be with Him
in Heaven. Betwixt that one and that other shall be no
time, and then shall all be brought to joy. And thus
said He in this Shewing: <i>Where is now any point of thy
pain, or thy grief?</i> And we shall be full blessed.</p>

<p>And here saw I verily that if He shewed now [to] us
His <i>Blissful</i> Cheer, there is no pain in earth or in other
place that should aggrieve us; but all things should be
to us joy and bliss. But because He sheweth to us time
of His Passion, as He bare it in <i>this</i> life, and His Cross,
therefore we are in distress and travail, with Him, as our
frailty asketh. And the cause why He suffereth [it to
be so,] is for [that] He will of His goodness make us the
higher with Him in His bliss; and for this little pain
that we suffer here, we shall have an high endless knowing
in God which we could<a name="FNanchor_3_108" id="FNanchor_3_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_108" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> never have without that.

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"The Love that made Him to suffer passeth so far all His
Pains as Heaven is above Earth"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Then said our good Lord Jesus Christ: <i>Art thou well
pleased that I suffered for thee?</i> I said: <i>Yea, good
Lord, I thank Thee; Yea, good Lord, blessed mayst Thou be.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Then said Jesus, our kind Lord: <i>If thou art pleased, I
am pleased: it is a joy, a bliss, an endless satisfying to me
that ever suffered I Passion for thee; and if I might suffer
more, I would suffer more.</i></p>

<p>In this feeling my understanding was lifted up into
Heaven, and there I saw three heavens: of which sight
I marvelled greatly. And though I see three heavens&mdash;and
all in the blessed manhood of Christ&mdash;none is more,
none is less, none is higher, none is lower, but [they are]
even-like in bliss.</p>

<p>For the First Heaven, Christ shewed me His Father;
in no bodily likeness, but in His property and in His
working. That is to say, I saw in Christ that the
Father is. The working of the Father is this, that He
giveth meed to His Son Jesus Christ. This gift and this
meed is so blissful to Jesus that His Father might have
given Him no meed that might have pleased Him better.
The first heaven, that is the pleasing of the Father,
shewed to me as one heaven; and it was full blissful:
for He is full pleased with all the deeds that Jesus hath
done about our salvation. Wherefore we be not only
His by His buying, but also by the courteous gift of His
Father we be His bliss, we be His meed, we be His
worship, we be His crown. (And this was a singular
marvel and a full delectable beholding, that we be His
crown!) This that I say is so great bliss to Jesus that
He setteth at nought all His travail, and His hard Passion,
and His cruel and shameful death.</p>

<p>And in these words: <i>If that I might suffer more, I would
suffer more</i>,&mdash;I saw in truth that as often as He <i>might</i> die,
so often He <i>would</i>, and love should never let Him have rest
till He had done it. And I beheld with great diligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
for to learn how often He would die if He might. And
verily the number passed mine understanding and my
wits so far that my reason might not, nor could, comprehend
it. And when He had thus oft died, or should,
yet He would set it at nought, for love: for all seemeth<a name="FNanchor_1_110" id="FNanchor_1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_110" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Him but little in regard of His love.</p>

<p>For though the sweet manhood of Christ might suffer
but once, the goodness in Him may never cease of
proffer: every day He is ready to the same, if it
might be. For if He said He would for my love
make new Heavens and new Earth, it were but little
in comparison;<a name="FNanchor_2_111" id="FNanchor_2_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_111" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for this might be done every day if
He would, without any travail. But to die for my
love so often that the number passeth creature's reason,
it is the highest proffer that our Lord God might make
to man's soul, as to my sight. Then meaneth He thus:
<i>How should it not be that I should not do for thy love all that
I might of deeds which grieve me not, sith I would, for thy
love, die so often, having no regard<a name="FNanchor_3_112" id="FNanchor_3_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_112" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to my hard pains?</i></p>

<p>And here saw I, for the Second<a name="FNanchor_4_113" id="FNanchor_4_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_113" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Beholding in this
blessed Passion <i>the love that made Him to suffer passeth
as far all His pains as Heaven is above Earth.</i> For
the pains was a noble, worshipful deed done in a
time by the working of love: but<a name="FNanchor_5_114" id="FNanchor_5_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_114" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Love was without
beginning, is, and shall be without ending. For which
love He said full sweetly these words: <i>If I might suffer
more, I would suffer more.</i> He said not, <i>If it were needful</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<i>to suffer more:</i> for though it were not needful, if He
<i>might</i> suffer more, He would.</p>

<p>This deed, and this work about our salvation, was
ordained as well as God might ordain it. And here
I saw a Full Bliss in Christ: for His bliss should not
have been full, if it might any better have been done.</p>

<p>And in these three words: <i>It is a joy, a bliss, an
endless satisfying to me</i>, were shewed three heavens,
as thus: For the joy, I understood the pleasure of the
Father; and for the bliss, the worship of the Son;
and for the endless satisfying,<a name="FNanchor_1_115" id="FNanchor_1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_115" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Holy Ghost. The

<p>And here saw I, for the Third Beholding in His
blissful Passion: that is to say, <i>the Joy and the Bliss
that make Him to be well-satisfied in it.</i> For our Courteous
Lord shewed His Passion to me in five manners: of
which the first is the bleeding of the head; the second
is, discolouring of His face; the third is, the plenteous
bleeding of the body, in seeming [as] from the scourging;
the fourth is, the deep dying:&mdash;these four are aforetold
for the pains of the Passion. And the fifth is [this] that
was shewed for the joy and the bliss of the Passion.</p>

<p>For it is God's will that we have true enjoying with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Him in our salvation, and therein He willeth [that] we
be mightily comforted and strengthened; and thus
willeth He that merrily with His grace our soul be
occupied. For we are His bliss: for in us He enjoyeth
without end; and so shall we in Him, with His grace.</p>

<p>And all that He hath done for us, and doeth, and
ever shall, was never cost nor charge to Him, nor
might be, but only that [which] He did in our manhood,
beginning at the sweet Incarnation and lasting
to the Blessed Uprise on Easter-morrow:<a name="FNanchor_3_117" id="FNanchor_3_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_117" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> so long
dured the cost and the charge about our redemption
in <i>deed</i>: of [the] which deed He enjoyeth endlessly,
as it is aforesaid.</p>

<p>Jesus willeth that we take heed to the bliss that
is in the blessed Trinity [because] of our salvation and
that <i>we</i> desire to have as much spiritual enjoying, with
His grace, (as it is aforesaid): that is to say, that the enjoying
of our salvation be [as] like to the joy that Christ
hath of our salvation as it may be while we are here.</p>

<p>All the Trinity wrought in the Passion of Christ,
ministering abundance of virtues and plenty of grace
to us by Him: but only the Maiden's Son suffered:
whereof all the blessed Trinity endlessly enjoyeth.
All this was shewed in these words: <i>Art thou well
pleased?</i>&mdash;and by that other word that Christ said: <i>If
thou art pleased, then am I pleased;</i>&mdash;as if He said: <i>It is
joy and satisfying enough to me, and I ask nought else of thee for
my travail but that I might well please thee</i>.</p>

<p>And in this He brought to mind the property of
a glad giver. A glad giver taketh but little heed of
the thing that he giveth, but all his desire and all
his intent is to please him and solace him to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
he giveth it. And if the receiver take the gift highly
and thankfully, then the courteous giver setteth at
nought all his cost and all his travail, for joy and
delight that he hath pleased and solaced him that he
loveth. Plenteously and fully was this shewed.</p>

<p>Think also wisely of the greatness of this word
"<i>ever</i>." For in it was shewed an high knowing of love<a name="FNanchor_4_118" id="FNanchor_4_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_118" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
that <i>He</i> hath in our salvation, with manifold joys that
follow of the Passion of Christ. One is that He rejoiceth
that He hath done it in deed, and He shall no more
suffer; another, that He bought us from endless pains
of hell.</p>

Lady Saint Mary, He shewed her highly rejoicing, as by
the meaning of these sweet words; as if He said: <i>Wilt
thou see how I love her, that thou mightest joy with me in the
love that I have in her and she in me?</i></p>

<p>And also (unto more understanding this sweet word)
our Lord speaketh to all mankind that shall be saved, as
it were all to one person, as if He said: <i>Wilt thou see in
her how thou art loved? For thy love I made her so high, so
noble and so worthy; and this pleaseth me, and so will I that it
doeth thee.</i></p>

<p>For after Himself she is the most blissful sight.</p>

<p>But hereof am I not learned to long to see her bodily
presence while I am here, but the virtues of her blessed
soul: her truth, her wisdom, her charity; whereby I
may learn to know myself and reverently dread my God.
And when our good Lord had shewed this and said this
word: <i>Wilt thou see her?</i> I answered and said: <i>Yea, good
Lord, I thank Thee; yea, good Lord, if it be Thy will.</i>
Oftentimes I prayed this, and I weened to have seen her
in bodily presence, but I saw her not so. And Jesus in
that word shewed me ghostly sight of her: right as I
had seen her afore little and simple, so He shewed her
then high and noble and glorious, and pleasing to Him
above all creatures.</p>

<p>And He willeth that it be known; that [so] all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
that please them in Him should please them in her, and
in the pleasance that He hath in her and she in Him.<a name="FNanchor_1_122" id="FNanchor_1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_122" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
And, to more understanding, He shewed this example:
<i>As if a man love a creature singularly, above all creatures,</i> he
willeth to make all creatures to love and to have pleasance
in that creature that he loveth so greatly. And in this
word that Jesus said: <i>Wilt thou see her?</i> methought it
was the most pleasing word that He might have given
me of her, with that ghostly Shewing that He gave me
of her. For our Lord shewed me nothing in special but
our Lady Saint Mary; and her He shewed three times.<a name="FNanchor_2_123" id="FNanchor_2_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_123" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The first was as she was with Child; the second was as
she was in her sorrows under the Cross; the third is as
she is now in pleasing, worship, and joy.</p>

never have rest till it cometh to Him, knowing that He
is fulness of joy, homely and courteous, blissful and

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">Often I wondered why by the great foreseeing wisdom of
God the beginning of sin was not hindered: for then, methought,
all should have been well." "Sin is behovable&mdash;[playeth
a needful part]&mdash;; but all shall be well"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>After this the Lord brought to my mind the longing
that I had to Him afore. And I saw that
nothing letted me but sin. And so I looked, generally,
upon us all, and methought: <i>If sin had not been, we should
all have been clean and like to our Lord, as He made us.</i></p>

<p>And thus, in my folly, afore this time often I
wondered why by the great foreseeing wisdom of God
the beginning of sin was not letted: for then, methought,
all should have been well. This stirring [of mind] was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
much to be forsaken, but nevertheless mourning and
sorrow I made therefor, without reason and discretion.</p>

<p>But Jesus, who in this Vision informed me of all that
is needful to me, answered by this word and said: <i>It
behoved that there should be sin;<a name="FNanchor_1_124" id="FNanchor_1_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_124" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but all shall be well, and all
shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well.</i></p>

<p>In this naked word <i>sin</i>, our Lord brought to my
mind, generally, <i>all that is not good</i>, and the shameful
despite and the utter noughting<a name="FNanchor_2_125" id="FNanchor_2_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_125" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that He bare for us in
this life, and His dying; and all the pains and passions
of all His creatures, ghostly and bodily; (for we be
all partly noughted, and we shall be noughted following
our Master, Jesus, till we be full purged, that is to say,
till we be fully noughted of our deadly flesh and of all
our inward affections which are not very good;) and the
beholding of this, with all pains that ever were or ever
shall be,&mdash;and with all these I understand the Passion
of Christ for most pain, and overpassing. All this was
shewed in a touch and quickly passed over into comfort:
for our good Lord would not that the soul were affeared
of this terrible sight.</p>

<p>But I saw not <i>sin</i>: for I believe it hath no manner of
substance nor no part of being, nor could it be known
but by the pain it is cause of.</p>

<p>And thus<a name="FNanchor_3_126" id="FNanchor_3_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_126" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> pain, <i>it</i> is something, as to my sight, for a
time; for it purgeth, and maketh us to know ourselves
and to ask mercy. For the Passion of our Lord is comfort
to us against all this, and so is His blessed will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
And for the tender love that our good Lord hath to all
that shall be saved, He comforteth readily and sweetly,
signifying thus: <i>It is sooth<a name="FNanchor_4_127" id="FNanchor_4_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_127" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that sin is cause of all this
pain; but all shall be well, and all shall be well, and all
manner [of] thing shall be well.</i></p>

<p>These words were said full tenderly, showing no
manner of blame to me nor to any that shall be saved.
Then were it a great unkindness<a name="FNanchor_5_128" id="FNanchor_5_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_128" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to blame or wonder
on God for my sin, since He blameth not me for sin.</p>

<p>And in these words I saw a marvellous high mystery
hid in God, which mystery He shall openly make known
to us in Heaven: in which knowing we shall verily see
the cause why He suffered sin to come. In which sight
we shall endlessly joy in our Lord God.<a name="FNanchor_6_129" id="FNanchor_6_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_129" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

things that exist, therefore, seeing that the Creator of them all
is supremely good, are themselves good. But because they are not like
their Creator, supremely and unchangeably good, their good may be
diminished and increased. But for good to be diminished is an evil,
although, however much it may be diminished, it is necessary, if the
being is to continue, that some good should remain to constitute the
being. For however small or of whatever kind the being may be, the
good which makes it a being cannot be destroyed without destroying
the being itself.... So long as a being is in process of corruption,
there is in it some good of which it is being deprived; and if a part of
the being should remain which cannot be corrupted, this will certainly
be an incorruptible being, and accordingly the process of corruption
will result in the manifestation of this great good. But if it do not
cease to be corrupted, neither can it cease to possess good of which
corruption may deprive it. But if it should be thoroughly and completely
consumed by corruption, there will then be no good left,
because there will be no being. Wherefore corruption can consume
the good only by consuming the being. Every being, therefore, is a
good; a great good, if it cannot be corrupted; a little good, if it can:
but in any case, only the foolish or ignorant will deny that it is a good.
And if it be wholly consumed by corruption, then the corruption itself
must cease to exist, as there is no being left in which it can dwell."

their <i>ensemble</i> constitutes the universe in all its wonderful order and

<p style="text-align:center">"Each brotherly compassion that man hath on his fellow
Christians, with charity, it is Christ in him"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Thus I saw how Christ hath compassion on us for
the cause of sin. And right as I was afore in the
[Shewing of the] Passion of Christ fulfilled with pain
and compassion, like so in this [sight] I was fulfilled, in
part, with compassion of all mine even-Christians&mdash;for
that well, well beloved people that shall be saved. For
God's servants, Holy Church, shall be shaken in sorrow
and anguish, tribulation in this world, as men shake a
cloth in the wind.</p>

<p>And as to this our Lord answered in this manner: <i>A
great thing shall I make hereof in Heaven of endless worship
and everlasting joys.</i></p>

<p>Yea, so far forth I saw, that our Lord joyeth of the
tribulations of His servants, with ruth and compassion.
On each person that He loveth, to His bliss for to bring
[them], He layeth something that is no blame in His
sight, whereby they are blamed and despised in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
world, scorned, mocked,<a name="FNanchor_1_130" id="FNanchor_1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_130" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and outcasted. And this He
doeth for to hinder the harm that they should take
from the pomp and the vain-glory of this wretched life,
and make their way ready to come to Heaven, and
up-raise them in His bliss everlasting. For He saith:
<i>I shall wholly break you of your vain affections and your vicious
pride; and after that I shall together gather you, and make you
mild and meek, clean and holy, by oneing to me.</i></p>

<p>And then I saw that each kind compassion that man
hath on his even-Christians with charity, it is Christ in
him.</p>

<p>That same noughting that was shewed in His Passion,
it was shewed again here in this Compassion. Wherein
were two manner of understandings in our Lord's meaning.
The one was the bliss that we are brought to,
wherein He willeth that we rejoice. The other is for
comfort in our pain: for He willeth that we perceive
that it shall all be turned to worship and profit by virtue
of His passion, that we perceive that we suffer not alone
but with Him, and see Him to be our Ground, and that
we see His pains and His noughting passeth so far all
that we may suffer, that it may not be fully thought.</p>

<p>The beholding of this will save us from murmuring<a name="FNanchor_2_131" id="FNanchor_2_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_131" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and despair in the feeling of our pains. And if we see
soothly that our sin deserveth it, yet His love excuseth
us, and of His great courtesy He doeth away all our
blame, and beholdeth us with ruth and pity as children
innocent and unloathful.</p>

<p>But in this I stood beholding things general, troublously
and mourning, saying thus to our Lord in
my meaning, with full great dread: <i>Ah! good Lord, how
might all be well, for the great hurt that is come, by sin, to

have some more open declaring wherewith I might be

<p>And to this our blessed Lord answered full meekly

was the most harm that ever was done, or ever shall be,
to the world's end; and also He shewed that this [sin]

<br /></p>


<p>He gave me understanding of two parts [of truth].
The one part is our Saviour and our salvation.
This blessed part is open and clear and fair and light,
and plenteous,&mdash;for all mankind that is of good will, and
shall be, is comprehended in this part. Hereto are we
bounden of God, and drawn and counselled and taught
inwardly by the Holy Ghost and outwardly by Holy
Church in the same grace. In this willeth our Lord that
we be occupied, joying in Him; for He enjoyeth in us.
The more plenteously that we take of this, with reverence
and meekness, the more thanks we earn of Him and
the more speed<a name="FNanchor_1_134" id="FNanchor_1_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_134" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to ourselves, thus&mdash;may we say&mdash;enjoying
<i>our</i> part of our Lord. The other [part] is hid
and shut up from us: that is to say, all that is beside our
salvation. For it is our Lord's privy counsel, and it
belongeth to the royal lordship of God to have His
privy counsel in peace, and it belongeth to His servant,
for obedience and reverence, not to learn<a name="FNanchor_2_135" id="FNanchor_2_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_135" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> wholly His
counsel. Our Lord hath pity and compassion on us for
that some creatures make themselves so busy therein;
and I am sure if we knew how much we should please
Him and ease ourselves by leaving it, we would. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
saints that be in Heaven, they will to know nothing but
that which our Lord willeth to shew them: and also
their charity and their desire is ruled after the will of our
Lord: and thus ought we to will, like to them. Then
shall we nothing will nor desire but the will of our
Lord, as they do: for we are all one in God's seeing.</p>

<p>And here was I learned that we shall trust and rejoice
only in our Saviour, blessed Jesus, for all thing.</p>

beginning) is desire in Him as long as we be in need, drawing
us up to His Bliss"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And thus our good Lord answered to all the questions
and doubts that I might make, saying full
comfortably: <i>I may make all thing well, I can make all
thing well, I will make all thing well, and I shall make all
thing well; and thou shalt see thyself that all manner of thing
shall be well.</i></p>

<p>In that He saith, <i>I may</i>, I understand [it] for the
Father; and in that He saith, <i>I can</i>, I understand [it] for
the Son; and where He saith, <i>I will</i>, I understand [it]
for the Holy Ghost; and where He saith, <i>I shall</i>, I
understand [it] for the unity of the blessed Trinity: three
Persons and one Truth; and where He saith, <i>Thou shalt

five words God willeth we be enclosed in rest and in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus shall the Spiritual Thirst of Christ have an
end. For this is the Spiritual Thirst of Christ: the love-longing
that lasteth, and ever shall, till we see that sight
on Doomsday. For we that shall be saved and shall be
Christ's joy and His bliss, some be yet here and some be
to come, and so shall some be, unto that day. Therefore
this is His thirst and love-longing, to have us altogether
whole in Him, to His bliss,&mdash;as to my sight. For
we be not now as fully whole in Him as we shall be
then.</p>

<p>For we know in our Faith, and also it was shewed in
all [the Revelations] that Christ Jesus is both God and
man. And anent the Godhead, He is Himself highest
bliss, and was, from without beginning, and shall be,
without end: which endless bliss may never be heightened
nor lowered in itself. For this was plenteously seen in
every Shewing, and specially in the Twelfth, where He
saith: <i>I am that [which] is highest</i>. And anent Christ's
Manhood, it is known in our Faith, and also [it was]
shewed, that He, with the virtue of Godhead, for love,
to bring us to His bliss suffered pains and passions, and
died. And these be the works of Christ's Manhood
wherein He rejoiceth; and that shewed He in the Ninth
Revelation, where He saith: <i>It is a joy and bliss and
endless pleasing to me that ever I suffered Passion for thee.</i> And
this is the bliss of Christ's <i>works</i>, and thus he signifieth
where He saith in that same Shewing: we be His bliss,
we be His meed, we be His worship, we be His crown.</p>

<p>For anent that Christ is our Head, He is glorified and
impassible; and anent His Body in which all His members
are knit, He is not yet fully glorified nor all
impassible. Therefore the same desire and thirst that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
He had upon the Cross (which desire, longing, and thirst,
as to my sight, was in Him from without beginning) the
same hath He yet, and shall [have] unto the time that the
last soul that shall be saved is come up to His bliss.</p>

<p>For as verily as there is a property in God of ruth and
pity, so verily there is a property in God of thirst and
longing. (And of the virtue of this longing in Christ,
<i>we</i> have to long again to Him: without which no soul
cometh to Heaven.) And this property of longing and
thirst cometh of the endless Goodness of God, even as
the property of pity cometh of His endless Goodness.
And though longing and pity are two sundry properties,
as to my sight, in this standeth the point of the Spiritual
Thirst: which is <i>desire in Him as long as we be in need</i>,
drawing us up to His bliss. And all this was seen in
the Shewing of Compassion: for that shall cease on
Doomsday.</p>

<p>Thus He hath ruth and compassion on us, and He
hath longing to have us; but His wisdom and His love
suffereth not the end to come till the best time.</p>

the soul took sundry understandings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>One was that He willeth we know that not only He
taketh heed to noble things and to great, but also to little
and to small, to low and to simple, to one and to other.
And so meaneth He in that He saith: <span class="smcap">All manner of
things</span> <i>shall be well</i>. For He willeth we know that the
least thing shall not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Another understanding is this, that there be deeds evil
done in our sight, and so great harms taken, that it
seemeth to us that it were impossible that ever it should
come to good end. And upon this we look, sorrowing
and mourning therefor, so that we cannot resign us unto
the blissful beholding of God as we should do. And
the cause of this is that the use of our reason is now so
blind, so low, and so simple, that we cannot know that
high marvellous Wisdom, the Might and the Goodness
of the blissful Trinity. And thus signifieth He when He
saith: <span class="smcap">Thou shalt see thyself</span> <i>if<a name="FNanchor_1_136" id="FNanchor_1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_136" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> all manner of things
shall be well</i>. As if He said: <i>Take now heed faithfully and
trustingly, and at the last end thou shalt verily see it in
fulness of joy</i>.</p>

<p>And thus in these same five words aforesaid: <i>I may
make all things well</i>, etc., I understand a mighty comfort
of all the works of our Lord God that are yet to come.
There is a Deed the which the blessed Trinity shall do
in the last Day, as to my sight, and when the Deed shall
be, and how it shall be done, is unknown of all creatures
that are beneath Christ, and shall be till when it is done.</p>

<p>["The Goodness and the Love of our Lord God
will that we wit [know] that it shall be; And the
Might and the Wisdom of him by the same Love will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
hill [conceal] it, and hide it from us what it shall be,
and how it shall be done."]<a name="FNanchor_2_137" id="FNanchor_2_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_137" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>And the cause why He willeth that we know [this
Deed shall be], is for that He would have us the more
eased in our soul and [the more] set at peace in love<a name="FNanchor_3_138" id="FNanchor_3_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_138" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;leaving
the beholding of all troublous things that might
keep us back from true enjoying of Him. This is that
Great Deed ordained of our Lord God from without
beginning, treasured and hid in His blessed breast, only
known to Himself: by which He shall make all things
well.</p>

<p>For like as the blissful Trinity made all things of
nought, right so the same blessed Trinity shall make
well all that is not well.</p>

<p>And in this sight I marvelled greatly and beheld
our Faith, marvelling thus: Our Faith is grounded
in God's word, and it belongeth to our Faith that we
believe that God's word shall be saved in all things;
and one point of our Faith is that many creatures shall
be condemned: as angels that fell out of Heaven for
pride, which be now fiends; and man<a name="FNanchor_4_139" id="FNanchor_4_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_139" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in earth that
dieth out of the Faith of Holy Church: that is to say,
they that be heathen men; and also man<a name="FNanchor_5_140" id="FNanchor_5_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_140" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that hath
received Christendom and liveth unchristian life and
so dieth out of charity: all these shall be condemned
to hell without end, as Holy Church teacheth me to
believe. And all this [so] standing,<a name="FNanchor_6_141" id="FNanchor_6_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_141" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> methought it was
impossible that all manner of things should be well, as
our Lord shewed in the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>And as to this I had no other answer in Shewing
of our Lord God but this: <i>That which is impossible to
thee is not impossible to me: I shall save my word in all
things and I shall make all things well.</i> Thus I was taught,
by the grace of God, that I should steadfastly hold
me in the Faith as I had aforehand understood, [and]
therewith that I should firmly believe that all things
shall be well, as our Lord shewed in the same time.</p>

<p>For this is the Great Deed that our Lord shall do,
in which Deed He shall save His word and He
shall make all well that is not well. How it shall
be done there is no creature beneath Christ that
knoweth it, nor shall know it till it is done; according
to the understanding that I took of our Lord's
meaning in this time.</p>

<p>And yet in this I desired, as [far] as I durst, that I
might have full sight of Hell and Purgatory.
But it was not my meaning to make proof of anything
that belongeth to the Faith: for I believed soothfastly
that Hell and Purgatory is for the same end that
Holy Church teacheth, but my meaning was that I
might have seen, for learning in all things that belong
to my Faith: whereby I might live the more to God's
worship and to my profit.</p>

<p>But for [all] my desire, I could<a name="FNanchor_1_142" id="FNanchor_1_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_142" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> [see] of this right
nought, save as it is aforesaid in the First Shewing,
where I saw that the devil is reproved of God and
endlessly condemned. In which sight I understood as
to all creatures that are of the devil's condition in this
life, and therein end, that there is no more mention
made of them afore God and all His Holy than of
the devil,&mdash;notwithstanding that they be of mankind&mdash;whether
they be christened or not.</p>

<p>For though the Revelation was made of goodness in
which was made little mention of evil, yet I was not
drawn thereby from any point of the Faith that Holy
Church teacheth me to believe. For I had sight of
the Passion of Christ in diverse Shewings,&mdash;the First,
the Second, the Fifth, and the Eighth,&mdash;wherein I had
in part a feeling of the sorrow of our Lady, and of His
true friends that saw Him in pain; but I saw not so
properly specified the Jews that did Him to death.
Notwithstanding I knew in my Faith that they were
accursed and condemned without end, saving those that
converted, by grace. And I was strengthened and
taught generally to keep me in the Faith in every point,
and in all as I had before understood: hoping that I was
therein with the mercy and the grace of God; desiring
and praying in my purpose that I might continue therein
unto my life's end.</p>

<p>And it is God's will that we have great regard to all
His deeds that He hath done, but evermore it needeth
us to leave the beholding what the Deed shall be. And
let us desire to be like our brethren which be saints in
Heaven, that will right nought but God's will and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
well pleased both with hiding and with shewing. For I
saw soothly in our Lord's teaching, the more we busy
us to know His secret counsels in this or any other
thing, the farther shall we be from the knowing thereof.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"All that is speedful for us to learn and to know, full
courteously will our Lord shew us"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Our Lord God shewed two manner of secret things.
One is this great Secret [Counsel] with all the privy
points that belong thereto: and these secret things He
willeth we should know [as <i>being</i>, but as] <i>hid</i> until the
time that He will clearly shew them to us. The other
are the secret things that He willeth to make open and
known to us; for He would have us understand that
it is His will that we should know them. They are
secrets to us not only for that He willeth that they be
secrets to us, but they are secrets to us for our blindness
and our ignorance; and thereof He hath great
ruth, and therefore He will Himself make them more
open to us, whereby we may know Him and love Him
and cleave to Him. For all that is speedful for us to
learn and to know, full courteously will our Lord shew
us: and [of] that is this [Shewing], with all the preaching
and teaching of Holy Church.</p>

<p>God shewed full great pleasance that He hath in all
men and women that mightily and meekly and with all
their will take the preaching and teaching of Holy
Church. For it is His Holy Church: He is the Ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
He is the Substance, He is the Teaching, He is the
Teacher, He is the End, He is the Meed for which
every kind soul travaileth.</p>

<p>And <i>this</i> [of the Shewing] is [made] known, and shall
be known to every soul to which the Holy Ghost declareth
it. And I hope truly that all those that seek
this, He shall speed: for they seek God.</p>

<p>All this that I have now told, and more that I shall
tell after, is comforting against sin. For in the Third
Shewing when I saw that God doeth all that is done, I
saw no sin: and then I saw that all <i>is</i> well. But when
God shewed me for sin, then said He: <i>All</i> <span class="smcap">shall</span> <i>be well</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"I desired to learn assuredly as to a certain creature that I
loved.... It is more worship to God to behold Him in <i>all</i>
than in any special thing"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And when God Almighty had shewed so plenteously
and joyfully of His Goodness, I desired to learn
assuredly as to a certain creature that I loved, if it
should continue in good living, which I hoped by the
grace of God was begun. And in this desire for a <i>singular</i>
Shewing, it seemed that I hindered myself: for I was
not taught in this time. And then was I answered in
my reason, as it were by a friendly intervenor<a name="FNanchor_1_143" id="FNanchor_1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_143" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: <i>Take it</i>
<span class="smcap">generally,</span> <i>and behold the graciousness of the Lord God as He
sheweth to thee: for it is more worship to God to behold Him</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<i>in all than in any special thing</i>. And therewith I learned
that it is more worship to God to know all-thing in
general, than to take pleasure in any special thing. And
if I should do wisely according to this teaching, I should
not only be glad for nothing in special, but I should not
be greatly distressed for no manner of thing<a name="FNanchor_2_144" id="FNanchor_2_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_144" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: for <span class="smcap">All</span>
<i>shall be well</i>. For the fulness of joy is to behold God in
<i>all</i>: for by the same blessed Might, Wisdom, and Love,
that He made all-thing, to the same end our good Lord
leadeth it continually, and thereto Himself shall bring
it; and when it is time we shall see it. And the ground
of this was shewed in the First [Revelation], and more
openly in the Third, where it saith: <i>I saw God in a
point</i>.</p>

<p>All that our Lord doeth is rightful, and that which
He suffereth<a name="FNanchor_3_145" id="FNanchor_3_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_145" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is worshipful: and in these two is comprehended
good and ill: for all that is good our Lord
doeth, and that which is evil our Lord suffereth. I say
not that any evil is worshipful, but I say the sufferance
of our Lord God is worshipful: whereby His Goodness
shall be known, without end, in His marvellous meekness
and mildness, by the working of mercy and grace.</p>

<p><i>Rightfulness</i> is that thing that is so good that [it] may
not be better than it is. For God Himself is very
Rightfulness, and all His works are done rightfully as
they are ordained from without beginning by His high
Might, His high Wisdom, His high Goodness. And
right as He ordained unto the best, right so He worketh
continually, and leadeth it to the same end; and He is
ever full-pleased with Himself and with all His works.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
And the beholding of this blissful accord is full sweet
to the soul that seeth by grace. All the souls that
shall be saved in Heaven without end be made rightful
in the sight of God, and by His own goodness: in
which rightfulness we are endlessly kept, and marvellously,
above all creatures.</p>

<p>And <i>Mercy</i> is a working that cometh of the goodness
of God, and it shall last in working all along, as
sin is suffered to pursue rightful souls. And when sin
hath no longer leave to pursue, then shall the working
of mercy cease, and then shall all be brought to rightfulness
and therein stand without end.</p>

<p>And by His sufferance we fall; and in His blissful
Love with His Might and His Wisdom we are kept; and
by mercy and grace we are raised to manifold more joys.</p>

<p>Thus in Rightfulness and Mercy He willeth to be
known and loved, now and without end. And the soul
that wisely beholdeth it in grace, it is well pleased with
both, and endlessly enjoyeth.</p>

known here in part;&mdash;though it be truly taken for the general
Man, yet it excludeth not the special. For what our good
Lord will do by His poor creatures, it is now unknown to me"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Our Lord God shewed that a deed shall be done,
and Himself shall do it, and I shall do nothing but
sin, and my sin shall not hinder<a name="FNanchor_1_146" id="FNanchor_1_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_146" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His Goodness working.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
And I saw that the beholding of this is a heavenly joy in
a fearing soul which evermore kindly by grace desireth
God's will. This deed shall be begun here, and it shall
be worshipful to God and plenteously profitable to His
lovers in earth; and ever as we come to Heaven we
shall see it in marvellous joy, and it shall last thus in
working unto the last Day; and the worship and the
bliss of it shall last in Heaven afore God and all His
Holy [ones] for ever.</p>

<p>Thus was this deed seen and understood in our Lord's
signifying: and the cause why He shewed it is to make
us rejoice in Him and in all His works. When I saw
His Shewing continued, I understood that it was shewed
for a great thing that was for to come, which thing God
shewed that He Himself should do it: which deed hath
these properties aforesaid. And this shewed He well
blissfully, signifying that I should take it myself faithfully
and trustingly.</p>

<p>But what this deed should be was kept secret from
me.</p>

<p>And in this I saw that He willeth not that we dread
to know the things that He sheweth: He sheweth them
because He would have us know them; by which
knowing He would have us love Him and have pleasure
and endlessly enjoy in Him. For the great love that He
hath to us He sheweth us all that is worshipful and
profitable for the time. And the things that He will
now have privy, yet of His great goodness He sheweth
them <i>close</i>: in which shewing He willeth that we believe
and understand that we shall see the same verily in His
endless bliss. Then ought we to rejoice in Him for all
that He sheweth and all that He hideth; and if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
steadily<a name="FNanchor_2_147" id="FNanchor_2_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_147" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and meekly do thus, we shall find therein great
ease; and endless thanks we shall have of Him therefor.</p>

<p>And this is the understanding of this word:&mdash;That it
shall be done for me, meaneth that it shall be done for
the general Man: that is to say, all that shall be saved.
It shall be worshipful and marvellous and plenteous, and
God Himself shall do it; and this shall be the highest
joy that may be, to behold the deed that God Himself
shall do, and man shall do right nought but sin. Then
signifieth our Lord God thus, as if He said: <i>Behold and
see! Here hast thou matter of meekness, here hast thou
matter of love, here hast thou matter to make nought of<a name="FNanchor_3_148" id="FNanchor_3_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_148" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> thyself,
here hast thou matter to enjoy in me;&mdash;and, for my love,
enjoy [thou] in me: for of all things, therewith mightest thou
please me most</i>.</p>

<p>And as long as we are in this life, what time that we
by our folly turn us to the beholding of the reproved,
tenderly our Lord God toucheth us and blissfully calleth
us, saying in our soul: <i>Let be all thy love, my dearworthy
child: turn thee to me&mdash;I am enough to thee&mdash;and enjoy in thy
Saviour and in thy salvation</i>. And that this is our Lord's
working in us, I am sure the soul that hath understanding<a name="FNanchor_4_149" id="FNanchor_4_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_149" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
therein by grace shall see it and feel it.</p>

<p>And though it be so that this deed be truly taken for
the general Man, yet it excludeth not the special. For
what our good Lord will do by His poor creatures, it is
now unknown to me.</p>

<p>But this deed and that other aforesaid, they are not
both one but two sundry. This deed shall be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
sooner (and that [time] shall be as we come to Heaven),
and to whom our Lord giveth it, it may be known here
in part. But that Great Deed aforesaid shall neither be
known in Heaven nor earth till it is done.</p>

<p>And moreover He gave special understanding and
teaching of working of miracles, as thus:&mdash;<i>It is known
that I have done miracles here afore, many and diverse, high
and marvellous, worshipful and great. And so as I have
done, I do now continually, and shall do in coming of time</i>.</p>

<p>It is known that afore miracles come sorrow and
anguish and tribulation<a name="FNanchor_5_150" id="FNanchor_5_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_150" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; and that is for that we should
know our own feebleness and our mischiefs that we are
fallen in by sin, to meeken us and make us to dread God
and cry for help and grace. Miracles come after that,
and they come of the high Might, Wisdom, and Goodness
of God, shewing His virtue and the joys of Heaven
so far at it may be in this passing life: and that to
strengthen our faith and to increase our hope, in charity.
Wherefore it pleaseth Him to be known and worshipped
in miracles. Then signifieth He thus: He willeth that
we be not borne over low for sorrow and tempests that
fall to us: for it hath ever so been afore miracle-coming.</p>

assented to sin, nor ever shall."&mdash;"For failing of Love on our
part, therefore is all our travail"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>God brought to my mind that I should sin. And for
pleasance that I had in beholding of Him, I
attended not readily to that shewing; and our Lord full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
mercifully abode, and gave me grace to attend. And
this shewing I took singularly to myself; but by all the
gracious comfort that followeth, as ye shall see, I was
learned to take it for all mine even-Christians: <i>all in
general and nothing in special</i>: though our Lord shewed me
that I should sin, by me alone is understood all.</p>

<p>And therein I conceived a soft dread. And to this
our Lord answered: <i>I keep thee full surely</i>. This word
was said with more love and secureness and spiritual
keeping than I can or may tell. For as it was shewed
that [I]<a name="FNanchor_1_151" id="FNanchor_1_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_151" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> should sin, right so was the comfort shewed:
secureness and keeping for all mine even-Christians.</p>

<p>What may make me more to love mine even-Christians
than to see in God that He loveth all that shall be saved
as it were all one soul?</p>

<p>For in every soul that shall be saved is a Godly Will
that never assented to sin, nor ever shall. Right as
there is a beastly will in the lower part that may will
no good, right so there is a Godly Will in the higher
part, which will is so good that it may never will evil,
but ever good. And therefore we are that which He
loveth and endlessly we do that which Him pleaseth.</p>

<p>This shewed our Lord in [shewing] the wholeness of
love that we stand in, in His sight: yea, that He loveth
us now as well while we are here, as He shall do while
we are there afore His blessed face. But for failing of
love on our part, therefore is all our travail.</p>

<p>Also God shewed that sin shall be no shame to man,
but worship. For right as to every sin is answering
a pain by truth, right so for every sin, to the same soul
is given a bliss by love: right as diverse sins are
punished with diverse pains according as they be grievous,
right so shall they be rewarded with diverse joys in
Heaven according as they have been painful and sorrowful
to the soul in earth. For the soul that shall come
to Heaven is precious to God, and the place so worshipful
that the goodness of God suffereth never that soul
to sin that shall come there without that the which sin
shall be rewarded; and it is made known without end,
and blissfully restored by overpassing worship.</p>

<p>For in this Sight mine understanding was lifted up
into Heaven, and then God brought merrily to my mind
David, and others in the Old Law without number; and
in the New Law He brought to my mind first Mary
Magdalene, Peter and Paul, and those of Inde;<a name="FNanchor_1_152" id="FNanchor_1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_152" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
Saint John of Beverley<a name="FNanchor_2_153" id="FNanchor_2_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_153" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; and others also without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
number: how they are known in the Church in earth
with their sins, and it is to them no shame, but all
is turned for them to worship. And therefore our
courteous Lord sheweth [it thus] for them here in part
like as it is there in fulness: for there the token of sin is
turned to worship.</p>

<p>And Saint John of Beverley, our Lord shewed him
full highly, in comfort to us for homeliness; and brought
to my mind how he is a dear neighbour,<a name="FNanchor_3_154" id="FNanchor_3_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_154" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and of our knowing.
And God called him <i>Saint John of Beverley</i> plainly
as we do, and that with a most glad sweet cheer, shewing
that he is a full high saint in Heaven in His sight,
and a blissful. And with this he made mention that in
his youth and in his tender age he was a dearworthy
servant to God, greatly God loving and dreading, and
yet God suffered him to fall, mercifully keeping him
that he perished not, nor lost no time. And afterward
God raised him to manifold more grace, and by the
contrition and meekness that he had in his living, God
hath given him in Heaven manifold joys, overpassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
that [which] he should have had if he had not fallen.
And that this is sooth, God sheweth in earth with
plenteous miracles doing about his body continually.</p>

<p>And all this was to make us glad and merry in love.</p>

Beverley in the midst of the wood called Deira, among the ruins of the
deserted Roman settlement of Pentuaria. This monastery, like so
many others of the Anglo-Saxons, was a double community of monks
and nuns. In 718 John retired for the remaining years of his life to
Beverley, where he died in 721 on the 7th of May.... He was
canonised in 1037. Henschenius the Bollandist, in the second tome of
May, has published books of the miracles wrought at the relicks of
St John of Beverley written by eye-witnesses. His sacred bones were
honourably translated into the church of Alfric, Archbishop of York, in
1037. A feast in honour of his translation was kept on the 25th of
October."&mdash;Alban Butler's <i>Lives of the Saints</i>, etc.

<p>Sin is the sharpest scourge that any chosen soul may
be smitten with: which scourge thoroughly beateth<a name="FNanchor_1_155" id="FNanchor_1_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_155" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
man and woman, and maketh him hateful in his own

he is not worthy but as to sink in hell,&mdash;till [that time]
when contrition taketh him by touching of the Holy
Ghost, and turneth the bitterness into hopes of God's
mercy. And then He beginneth his wounds to heal,
and the soul to quicken [as it is] turned unto the life of
Holy Church. The Holy Ghost leadeth him to confession,
with all his will to shew his sins nakedly and
truly, with great sorrow and great shame that he hath
defouled the fair image of God. Then receiveth he
penance for every sin [as] enjoined by his doomsman<a name="FNanchor_3_157" id="FNanchor_3_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_157" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
that is grounded in Holy Church by the teaching of the
Holy Ghost. And this is one meekness that greatly
pleaseth God; and also bodily sickness of God's sending,
and also sorrow and shame from without, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
reproof, and despite of this world, with all manner of
grievance and temptations that we be cast in,<a name="FNanchor_4_158" id="FNanchor_4_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_158" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> bodily
and ghostly.</p>

<p>Full preciously our Lord keepeth us when it seemeth
to us that we are near forsaken and cast away for our
sin and because we have deserved it. And because of
meekness that we get hereby, we are raised well-high
in God's sight by His grace, with so great contrition,
and also compassion, and true longing to God. Then
they be suddenly delivered from sin and from pain, and
taken up to bliss, and made even high saints.</p>

<p>By contrition we are made clean, by compassion we
are made ready, and by true longing toward God we
are made worthy. These are three means, as I understand,
whereby that all souls come to heaven: that is to
say, that have been sinners in earth and shall be saved:
for by these three medicines it behoveth that every soul
be healed. Though the soul be healed, his wounds are
seen afore God,&mdash;not as wounds but as worships. And
so on the contrary-wise, as we be punished here with
sorrow and penance, we shall be rewarded in heaven
by the courteous love of our Lord God Almighty, who
willeth that none that come there lose his travail in any
degree. For He [be]holdeth sin as sorrow and pain to
His lovers, to whom He assigneth no blame, for love.
The meed that we shall receive shall not be little, but it
shall be high, glorious, and worshipful. And so shall
shame be turned to worship and more joy.</p>

in us, being and working; but we be not alway in peace
and in love. But He willeth that we take heed thus
that He is Ground of all our whole life in love; and
furthermore that He is our everlasting Keeper and
mightily defendeth us against our enemies, that be full
fell and fierce upon us;&mdash;and so much our need is the

"To me was shewed no harder hell than sin." "God willeth

loveth it"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>This is a sovereign friendship of our courteous Lord
that He keepeth us so tenderly while we be in sin;
and furthermore He toucheth us full privily and sheweth
us our sin by the sweet light of mercy and grace. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
when we see our self so foul, then ween we that God
were wroth with us for our sin, and then are we stirred
of the Holy Ghost by contrition unto prayer and desire
for the amending of our life with all our mights, to
slacken the wrath of God, unto the time we find a rest
in soul and a softness in conscience. Then hope we that
God hath forgiven us our sins: and it is truth. And
then sheweth our courteous Lord Himself to the soul&mdash;well-merrily
and with glad cheer&mdash;with friendly welcoming
as if it<a name="FNanchor_1_161" id="FNanchor_1_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_161" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> had been in pain and in prison, saying sweetly
thus: <i>My darling I am glad thou art come to me: in all thy
wo I have ever been with thee; and now seest thou my loving
and we be oned in bliss</i>. Thus are sins forgiven by mercy
and grace, and our soul is worshipfully received in joy
like as it shall be when it cometh to Heaven, as oftentimes
as it cometh by the gracious working of the Holy
Ghost and the virtue of Christ's Passion.</p>

<p>Here understand I in truth that all manner of things
are made ready for us by the great goodness of God, so
far forth that what time we be ourselves in peace and
charity, we be verily saved. But because we may not
have this in fulness while we are here, therefore it falleth
to us evermore to live in sweet prayer and lovely longing
with our Lord Jesus. For He longeth ever to bring us
to the fulness of joy; as it is aforesaid, where He
sheweth the Spiritual Thirst.</p>

<p>But now if any man or woman because of all this
spiritual comfort that is aforesaid, be stirred by folly to
say or to think: <i>If this be true, then were it good to sin [so
as] to have the more meed</i>,&mdash;or else to charge the less
[guilt] to sin,&mdash;beware of this stirring: for verily if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
come it is untrue, and of the enemy of the same true love
that teacheth us that we should hate sin only for love.
I am sure by mine own feeling, the more that any kind<a name="FNanchor_2_162" id="FNanchor_2_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_162" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
soul seeth this in the courteous love of our Lord God,
the lother he is to sin and the more he is ashamed. For
if afore us were laid [together] all the pains in Hell and
in Purgatory and in Earth&mdash;death and other&mdash;, and [by
itself] sin, we should rather choose all that pain than sin.
For sin is so vile and so greatly to be hated that it may
be likened to no pain which is not sin. And to me was
shewed no harder hell than sin. For a kind<a name="FNanchor_3_163" id="FNanchor_3_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_163" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> soul hath
no hell but sin.</p>

<p>And [when] we give our intent to love and meekness,
by the working of mercy and grace we are made all fair
and clean. As mighty and as wise as God is to save
men, so willing He is. For Christ Himself is [the]
ground of all the laws of Christian men, and He taught
us to do good against ill: here may we see that He
is Himself this charity, and doeth to us as He teacheth
us to do. For He willeth that we be like Him in wholeness
of endless love to ourself and to our even-Christians:
no more than His love is broken to us for our sin, no
more willeth He that our love be broken to ourself and
to our even-Christians: but [that we] endlessly hate the
sin and endlessly love the soul, as God loveth it. Then
shall we hate sin like as God hateth it, and love the
soul as God loveth it. And this word that He said
is an endless comfort: <i>I keep thee securely</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"<i>I am the Ground of thy beseeching.</i>" "Also to prayer
belongeth thanking"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>After this our Lord shewed concerning Prayer. In
which Shewing I see two conditions in our Lord's
signifying: one is rightfulness, another is sure trust.</p>

<p>But yet oftentimes our trust is not full: for we are
not sure that God heareth us, as we think because of
our unworthiness, and because we feel right nought,
(for we are as barren and dry oftentimes after our
prayers as we were afore); and this, in our feeling our
folly, is cause of our weakness.<a name="FNanchor_1_164" id="FNanchor_1_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_164" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> For thus have I felt
in myself.</p>

<p>And all this brought our Lord suddenly to my mind,
and shewed these words, and said: <i>I am Ground of thy
beseeching: first it is my will that thou have it; and after, I make
thee to will it; and after, I make thee to beseech it and thou beseechest
it. How should it then be that thou shouldst not have
thy beseeching?</i></p>

<p>And thus in the first reason, with the three that
follow, our good Lord sheweth a mighty comfort, as
it may be seen in the same words. And in the first
reason,&mdash;where He saith: <i>And thou beseechest it</i>, there
He sheweth [His] full great pleasance, and endless meed
that He will give us for our beseeching. And in the
second reason, where He saith: <i>How should it then be?</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
etc., this was said for an impossible [thing]. For it is
most impossible that we should beseech mercy and grace,
and not have it. For everything that our good Lord
maketh us to beseech, Himself hath ordained it to us
from without beginning. Here may we see that our
beseeching is not cause of God's goodness; and that
shewed He soothfastly in all these sweet words when
He saith: <i>I am [the] Ground</i>.&mdash;And our good Lord
willeth that this be known of His lovers in earth; and
the more that we know [it] the more should we beseech,
if it be wisely taken; and so is our Lord's meaning.</p>

<p>Beseeching is a true, gracious, lasting will of the soul,
oned and fastened into the will of our Lord by the sweet
inward work of the Holy Ghost. Our Lord Himself,
He is the first receiver of our prayer, as to my sight,
and taketh it full thankfully and highly enjoying; and He
sendeth it up above and setteth it in the Treasure, where
it shall never perish. It is there afore God with all His
Holy continually received, ever speeding [the help of]
our needs; and when we shall receive our bliss it shall
be given us for a degree of joy, with endless worshipful
thanking from<a name="FNanchor_2_165" id="FNanchor_2_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_165" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Him.</p>

<p>Full glad and merry is our Lord of our prayer; and
He looketh thereafter and He willeth to have it because
with His grace He maketh us like to Himself in condition
as we are in kind: and so is His blissful will.
Therefore He saith thus: <i>Pray inwardly,<a name="FNanchor_3_166" id="FNanchor_3_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_166" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> though thee
thinketh it savour thee not: for it is profitable, though thou feel
not, though thou see nought; yea, though thou think thou canst
not. For in dryness and in barrenness, in sickness and in</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<i>feebleness, then is thy prayer well-pleasant to me, though thee
thinketh it savour thee nought but little. And so is all thy believing
prayer in my sight.</i> For the meed and the endless thanks
that He will give us, <i>therefor</i> He is covetous to have us
pray continually in His sight. God accepteth the goodwill
and the travail of His servant, howsoever we feel:
wherefore it pleaseth Him that we work both in our
prayers and in good living, by His help and His grace,
reasonably with discretion keeping our powers<a name="FNanchor_4_167" id="FNanchor_4_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_167" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> [turned]
to Him, till when that we have Him that we seek, in
fulness of joy: that is, Jesus. And that shewed He in
the Fifteenth [Revelation], farther on, in this word:
<i>Thou shalt have me to thy meed</i>.</p>

<p>And also to prayer belongeth thanking. Thanking is
a true inward knowing, with great reverence and lovely
dread turning ourselves with all our mights unto the
working that our good Lord stirreth us to, enjoying and
thanking inwardly. And sometimes, for plenteousness it
breaketh out with voice, and saith: <i>Good Lord, I thank
Thee!<a name="FNanchor_5_168" id="FNanchor_5_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_168" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Blessed mayst Thou be!</i> And sometime when the
heart is dry and feeleth not, or else by temptation of our
enemy,&mdash;then it is driven by reason and by grace to cry
upon our Lord with voice, rehearing His blessed Passion
and His great Goodness; and the virtue of our Lord's
word turneth into the soul and quickeneth the heart and
entereth<a name="FNanchor_6_169" id="FNanchor_6_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_169" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> it by His grace into true working, and maketh
it pray right blissfully. And truly to enjoy our Lord, it
is a full blissful thanking in His sight.</p>

trust be both alike large. For if we trust not as much
as we pray, we do not full worship to our Lord in our
prayer, and also we tarry<a name="FNanchor_1_170" id="FNanchor_1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_170" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and pain our self. The cause
is, as I believe, that we know not truly that our Lord is
[the] Ground on whom our prayer springeth; and also
that we know not that it is given us by the grace of His
love. For if we knew this, it would make us to trust
to have, of our Lord's gift, all that we desire. For I
am sure that no man asketh mercy and grace with true
meaning, but if mercy and grace be first given to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>But sometimes it cometh to our mind that we have
prayed long time, and yet we think to ourselves that
we have not our asking. But herefor should we not
be in heaviness. For I am sure, by our Lord's signifying,
that either we abide a better time, or more grace, or
a better gift. He willeth that we have true knowing in
Himself that He is Being; and in this knowing He
willeth that our understanding be grounded, with all our
mights and all our intent and all our meaning; and in
this ground He willeth that we take our place and our
dwelling, and by the gracious light of Himself He willeth
that we have understanding of the things that follow.
The first is our noble and excellent making; the second,
our precious and dearworthy again-buying; the third,
all-thing that He hath made beneath us, [He hath made]
to serve us, and for our love keepeth it. Then signifieth
He thus, as if He said: <i>Behold and see that I have
done all this before thy prayers; and now thou art, and
prayest me</i>. And thus He signifieth that it belongeth to
us to learn that the greatest deeds be [already] done, as
Holy Church teacheth; and in the beholding of this,
with thanking, we ought to pray for the deed that is now
in doing: and that is, that He rule and guide us, to His
worship, in this life, and bring us to His bliss. And
therefor He hath done all.</p>

<p>Then signifieth He thus: that we [should] see that
He doeth it, and that we [should] pray therefor. For the
one is not enough. For if we pray and see not that He
doeth it, it maketh us heavy and doubtful; and that is
not His worship. And if we see that He doeth, and we
pray not, we do not our debt, and so may it not be: that
is to say, so is it not [the thing that is] in His beholding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
But to see that He doeth it, and to pray forthwithal,&mdash;so
is he worshipped and we sped. All-thing that our Lord
hath ordained to do, it is His will that we pray therefor,
either in special or in general. And the joy and the
bliss that it is to Him, and the thanks and the worship
that we shall have therefor, it passeth the understanding
of creatures, as to my sight.</p>

<p>For prayer is a right<a name="FNanchor_2_171" id="FNanchor_2_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_171" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> understanding of that fulness
of joy that is to come, with well-longing and sure trust.
Failing of our bliss that we be kindly ordained to,
maketh us to long; true understanding and love, with
sweet mind in our Saviour, graciously maketh us to
trust. And in these two workings our Lord beholdeth
us continually<a name="FNanchor_3_172" id="FNanchor_3_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_172" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>: for it is our due part, and His Goodness
may no less assign to us.</p>

<p>Thus it belongeth to us to do our diligence; and
when we have done it, then shall us yet think that [it]
is nought,&mdash;and sooth it is. But if we do as we can,
and ask, in truth, for mercy and grace, all that faileth
us we shall find in Him. And thus signifieth He where
He saith: <i>I am Ground of thy beseeching</i>. And thus in
this blessed word, with the Shewing, I saw a full overcoming
against all our weakness and all our doubtful
dreads.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"Prayer uniteth the soul to God"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Prayer oneth the soul to God. For though the
soul be ever like to God in kind and substance,
restored by grace, it is often unlike in condition, by sin
on man's part. Then is prayer a witness that the soul
willeth as God willeth; and it comforteth the conscience
and enableth man to grace. And thus He teacheth us
to pray, and mightily to trust that we shall have it. For
He beholdeth us in love and would make us partners of
His good deed, and therefore He stirreth us to pray for
that which it pleaseth him to do. For which prayer and
good will, that we have of His gift, He will reward us
and give us endless meed.</p>

<p>And this was shewed in this word: <i>And thou beseechest
it</i>. In this word God shewed so great pleasance and so
great content, as though He were much beholden to us
for every good deed that we do (and yet it is <i>He</i> that
doeth it) because that we beseech Him mightily to do
all things that seem to Him good: as if He said: <i>What
might then please me more than to beseech me, mightily, wisely,
and earnestly, to do that thing that I shall do?</i></p>

<p>And thus the soul by prayer accordeth to God.</p>

<p>But when our courteous Lord of His grace sheweth
Himself to our soul, we have that [which] we desire.
And then we see not, for the time, what we should more
pray, but all our intent with all our might is set wholly
to the beholding of Him. And this is an high unperceivable
prayer, as to my sight: for all the cause wherefor
we pray it, is oned into the sight and beholding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Him to whom we pray; marvellously enjoying with
reverent dread, and with so great sweetness and delight
in Him that we can pray right nought but as He stirreth
us, for the time. And well I wot, the more the soul
seeth of God, the more it desireth Him by His grace.</p>

<p>But when we see Him not so, then feel we need and
cause to pray, because of failing, for enabling of our
self, to Jesus. For when the soul is tempested, troubled,
and left to itself by unrest, then it is time to pray, for
to make itself pliable and obedient<a name="FNanchor_1_173" id="FNanchor_1_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_173" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to God. (But the
soul by no manner of prayer maketh God pliant to it:
for He is ever alike in love.)</p>

<p>And this I saw: that what time we see needs wherefor
we pray, then our <i>good Lord followeth us</i>, helping our
desire; and when we of His special grace plainly behold
Him, seeing none other needs, then <i>we follow Him</i> and
He draweth us unto Him by love. For I saw and felt
that His marvellous and plentiful Goodness fulfilleth all
our powers; and therewith I saw that His continuant
working in all manner of things is done so goodly, so
wisely, and so mightily, that it overpasseth all our
imagining, and all that we can ween and think; and
then we can do no more but behold Him, enjoying, with
an high, mighty desire to be all oned unto Him,&mdash;centred
to His dwelling,&mdash;and enjoy in His loving and
delight in His goodness.</p>

<p>And then shall we, with His sweet grace, in our own
meek continuant prayer come unto Him now in this life
by many privy touchings of sweet spiritual sights and
feeling, measured to us as our simpleness may bear it.
And this is wrought, and shall be, by the grace of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Holy Ghost, so long till we shall die in longing, for love.
And then shall we all come into our Lord, our Self
clearly knowing, and God fully having; and we shall
endlessly be all had in God: Him verily seeing and
fully feeling, Him spiritually hearing, and Him delectably
in-breathing, and [of] Him sweetly drinking.<a name="FNanchor_2_174" id="FNanchor_2_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_174" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>And then shall we see God face to face, homely and
fully. The creature that is made shall see and endlessly
behold God which is the Maker. For thus may no man
see God and live after, that is to say, in this deadly life.
But when He of His special grace will shew Himself
here, He strengtheneth the creature above its self,
and He measureth the Shewing, after His own will,
as it is profitable for the time.</p>

FOURTEEN REVELATIONS</i></a></h3>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"God is endless, sovereign Truth,&mdash;Wisdom,&mdash;Love, not-made;
and man's Soul is a creature in God which hath the
same properties made"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>God shewed in all the Revelations, oftentimes, that
man worketh evermore His will and His worship
lastingly without any stinting. And <i>what</i> this work is,
was shewed in the First, and that in a marvellous example:
for it was shewed in the working of the soul of
our blissful Lady, Saint Mary: [that is, the working of]
Truth and Wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_1_175" id="FNanchor_1_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_175" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And <i>how</i> [it is done] I hope by
the grace of the Holy Ghost I shall tell, as I saw.</p>

<p>Truth seeth God, and Wisdom beholdeth God, and of
these two cometh the third: that is, a holy marvellous<a name="FNanchor_2_176" id="FNanchor_2_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_176" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
delight in God; which is Love. Where Truth and
Wisdom are verily, there is Love verily, coming of them
both. And all of God's making: for He is endless
sovereign Truth, endless sovereign Wisdom, endless
sovereign Love, unmade; and man's Soul is a creature
in God which hath the same properties <i>made</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_177" id="FNanchor_3_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_177" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and evermore
it doeth that it was made for: it seeth God, it
beholdeth God, and it loveth God. Whereof God
enjoyeth in the creature; and the creature in God, endlessly
marvelling.</p>

<p>In which marvelling he seeth his God, his Lord, his
Maker so high, so great, and so good, in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
with him that is made, that scarcely the creature seemeth
ought to the self. But the clarity and the clearness of
Truth and Wisdom maketh him to see and to bear
witness<a name="FNanchor_4_178" id="FNanchor_4_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_178" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that he is made for Love: in which God
endlessly keepeth him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"All heavenly things and all earthly things that belong to
Heaven are comprehended in these two judgments"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>God deemeth us [looking] upon our Nature-Substance,
which is ever kept one in Him, whole and safe
without end: and <i>this</i> doom is [because] of His rightfulness
[in the which it is made and kept]. And man
judgeth [looking] upon our changeable Sense-soul, which
seemeth now one [thing], now other,&mdash;according as it
taketh of the [higher or lower] parts,&mdash;and [is that
which] showeth outward. And <i>this</i> wisdom [of man's
judgment] is <i>mingled</i> [because of the diverse things it
beholdeth]. For sometimes it is good and easy, and
sometimes it is hard and grievous. And in as much as
it is good and easy it belongeth to the rightfulness; and
in as much as it is hard and grievous [by reason of the
sin beheld, which sheweth in our Sense-soul,] our good
Lord Jesus reformeth it by [the working in our Sense-soul
of] mercy and grace through the virtue of His
blessed Passion, and so bringeth it to the rightfulness.</p>

<p>And though these two [judgments] be thus accorded
and oned, yet both shall be known in Heaven without
end. The first doom, which is of God's rightfulness, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
[because] of His high endless life [in our Substance];
and this is that fair sweet doom that was shewed in all
the fair Revelation, in which I saw Him assign to us
no manner of blame. But though this was sweet and
delectable, yet in the beholding only of this, I could not
be fully eased: and that was because of the doom of
Holy Church, which I had afore understood and which
was continually in my sight. And therefore by <i>this</i>
doom methought I understood that sinners are worthy
sometime of blame and wrath; but these two could I
not see in God; and therefore my desire was more than
I can or may tell. For the higher doom was shewed by
God Himself in that same time, and therefore me behoved
needs to take it; and the lower doom was learned
me afore in Holy Church, and therefore I might in no
way leave the lower doom. Then was this my desire:
that I might see in God in what manner that which the
doom of Holy Church teacheth is true in His sight, and
how it belongeth to me verily to know it; whereby the
two dooms might both be saved, so as it were worshipful
to God and right way to me.</p>

<p>And to all this I had none other answer but a marvellous
example of a lord and of a servant, as I shall tell
after: and that full mistily shewed.<a name="FNanchor_1_179" id="FNanchor_1_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_179" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And yet I stand
desiring, and will unto my end, that I might by grace
know these two dooms as it belongeth to me. For all
heavenly, and all earthly things that belong to Heaven,
are comprehended in these two dooms. And the more
understanding, by the gracious leading of the Holy
Ghost, that we have of these two dooms, the more we
shall see and know our failings. And ever the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
that we see them, the more, of nature, by grace, we
shall long to be fulfilled of endless joy and bliss. For
we are made thereto, and our Nature-Substance is now
blissful in God, and hath been since it was made, and
shall be without end.</p>

we deserve pain and wrath." "He is God: Good, Life,
Truth, Love, Peace: His Clarity and His Unity suffereth
Him not to be wroth"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>But our passing life that we have here in our sense-soul
knoweth not what our Self is. [And when we
verily and clearly see and know what our Self is]<a name="FNanchor_1_180" id="FNanchor_1_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_180" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> then
shall we verily and clearly see and know our Lord God
in fulness of joy. And therefore it behoveth needs to be
that the nearer we be to our bliss, the more we shall
long [after it]: and that both by nature and by grace. We
may have knowing of our Self in this life by continuant
help and virtue of our high Nature. In which knowing
we may exercise and grow, by forwarding and speeding
of mercy and grace; but we may never fully know our
Self until the last point: in which point this passing life
and manner of pain and woe shall have an end. And
therefore it belongeth properly to us, both by nature
and by grace, to long and desire with all our mights to
know our Self in fulness of endless joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet in all this time, from the beginning to the
end, I had two manner of beholdings. The one was
endless continuant love, with secureness of keeping, and
blissful salvation,&mdash;for of this was all <i>the Shewing</i>. The
other was of the common teaching of Holy Church, in
which I was afore informed and grounded&mdash;and with all
my will having in use and understanding. And the beholding
of <i>this</i> went not from me: for by the Shewing I was
not stirred nor led therefrom in no manner of point, but I
had therein teaching to love it and find it good<a name="FNanchor_2_181" id="FNanchor_2_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_181" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: whereby
I might, by the help of our Lord and His grace, increase
and rise to more heavenly knowing and higher loving.</p>

<p>And thus in all the Beholding methought it was needful
to see and to know that we are sinners, and do many
evils that we ought to leave, and leave many good deeds
undone that we ought to do: wherefore we deserve pain
and wrath. And notwithstanding all this, I saw soothfastly
that our Lord was never wroth, nor ever shall be.
For He is God: Good, Life, Truth, Love, Peace; His
Clarity<a name="FNanchor_3_182" id="FNanchor_3_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_182" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and His Unity suffereth Him not to be wroth.
For I saw truly that it is against the property of His
Might to be wroth, and against the property of His
Wisdom, and against the property of His Goodness.
God is the Goodness that may not be wroth, for He is
not [other] but Goodness: our soul is oned to Him,
unchangeable Goodness, and between God and our soul
is neither wrath nor forgiveness in His sight. For our
soul is so fully oned to God of His own Goodness that
between God and our soul may be right nought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>And to this understanding was the soul led by love
and drawn by might in every Shewing: <i>that it is thus</i>
our good Lord shewed, and <i>how it is thus in truth of His
great Goodness</i>. And He willeth that we desire to learn
it&mdash;that is to say, as far as it belongeth to His creature
to learn it. For all things that the simple soul<a name="FNanchor_4_183" id="FNanchor_4_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_183" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> understood,
God willeth that they be shewed and [made]
known. For the things that He will have privy, mightily
and wisely Himself He hideth them, for love. For I saw
in the same Shewing that much privity is hid, which may
never be known until the time that God of His goodness
hath made us worthy to see it; and therewith I am well-content,
abiding our Lord's will in this high marvel.
And now I yield me to my Mother, Holy Church, as a
simple child oweth.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"We fail oftentimes of the sight of Him, and anon we fall
into our self, and then find we no feeling of right,&mdash;nought but
contrariness that is in our self"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Two things belong to our soul as duty: the one is
that we reverently marvel, the other that we
meekly suffer, ever enjoying in God. For He would
have us understand that we shall in short time see clearly
in Himself all that we desire.</p>

<p>And notwithstanding all this, I beheld and marvelled
greatly: <i>What is the mercy and forgiveness of God?</i> For
by the teaching that I had afore, I understood that the
mercy of God should be the forgiveness of His wrath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
after the time that we have sinned. For methought
that to a soul whose meaning and desire is to love, the
wrath of God was harder than any other pain, and therefore
I took<a name="FNanchor_1_184" id="FNanchor_1_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_184" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that the forgiveness of His wrath should
be one of the principal points of His mercy. But howsoever
I might behold and desire, I could in no wise see
this point in all the Shewing.<a name="FNanchor_2_185" id="FNanchor_2_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_185" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But how I understood and saw of the work of mercy,
I shall tell somewhat, as God will give me grace. I
understood this: Man is changeable in this life, and by
frailty and overcoming falleth into sin: he is weak and
unwise of himself, and also his will is overlaid. And
in this time he is in tempest and in sorrow and woe; and
the cause is blindness: for he seeth not God. For if
he saw God continually, he should have no mischievous
feeling, nor any manner of motion or yearning that
serveth to sin.<a name="FNanchor_3_186" id="FNanchor_3_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_186" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Thus saw I, and felt in the same time; and methought
that the sight and the feeling was high and plenteous
and gracious in comparison with that which our common
feeling is in this life; but yet I thought it was but small
and low in comparison with the great desire that the soul
hath to see God.</p>

<p>For I felt in me five manner of workings, which be
these: Enjoying, mourning, desire, dread, and sure hope.
Enjoying: for God gave me understanding and knowing
that it was Himself that I saw; mourning: and that was for
failing; desire: and that was I might see Him ever more
and more, understanding and knowing that we shall never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
have full rest till we see Him verily and clearly in
heaven; dread was: for it seemed to me in all that time
that that sight should fail, and I be left to myself; sure
hope was in the endless love: that I saw I should be
kept by His mercy and brought to His bliss. And the
joying in His sight with this sure hope of His merciful
keeping made me to have feeling and comfort so that
mourning and dread were not greatly painful. And yet
in all this I beheld in the Shewing of God that this
manner of sight may not be continuant in this life,&mdash;and
that for His own worship and for increase of our endless
joy. And therefore we fail oftentimes of the sight of
Him, and anon we fall into our self, and then find we
no feeling of right,&mdash;naught but contrariness that is in
our self; and that of the elder root of our first sin,<a name="FNanchor_4_187" id="FNanchor_4_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_187" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
with all the sins that follow, of our contrivance.
And in this we are in travail and tempest<a name="FNanchor_5_188" id="FNanchor_5_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_188" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> with feeling
of sins, and of pain in many divers manners, spiritual
and bodily, as it is known to us in this life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"I beheld the property of Mercy, and I beheld the property of
Grace: which have two manners of working in one love"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>But our good Lord the Holy Ghost, which is endless
life dwelling in our soul, full securely keepeth us;
and worketh therein a peace and bringeth it to ease by
grace, and accordeth it to God and maketh it pliant.<a name="FNanchor_1_189" id="FNanchor_1_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_189" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
And this is the mercy and the way that our Lord continually
leadeth us in as long as we be here in this life
which is changeable.</p>

<p>For I saw no wrath but on man's part; and that
forgiveth He in us. For wrath is not else but a
forwardness and a contrariness to peace and love; and
either it cometh of failing of might, or of failing of
wisdom, or of failing of goodness: which failing is not in
God, but is on our part. For we by sin and wretchedness
have in us a wretched and continuant contrariness
to peace and to love. And that shewed He full often
in His lovely Regard of Ruth and Pity.<a name="FNanchor_2_190" id="FNanchor_2_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_190" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For the ground
of mercy is love, and the working of mercy is our keeping
in love. And this was shewed in such manner that
I could<a name="FNanchor_3_191" id="FNanchor_3_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_191" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> not have perceived of the part of mercy but as
it were alone in love; that is to say, as to my sight.</p>

<p>Mercy is a sweet gracious working in love, mingled
with plenteous pity: for mercy worketh in keeping us,
and mercy worketh turning to us all things to good.
Mercy, by love, suffereth us to fail in measure and in as
much as we fail, in so much we fall; and in as much as
we fall, in so much we die: for it needs must be that
we die in so much as we fail of the sight and feeling of
God that is our life. Our failing is dreadful, our falling
is shameful, and our dying is sorrowful: but in all this
the sweet eye of pity and love is lifted never off us, nor
the working of mercy ceaseth.<a name="FNanchor_4_192" id="FNanchor_4_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_192" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>For I beheld the property of mercy, and I beheld the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
property of grace: which have two manners of working
in one love. Mercy is a pitiful property which
belongeth to the Motherhood in tender love; and grace
is a worshipful property which belongeth to the
royal Lordship in the same love. Mercy worketh:
keeping, suffering, quickening, and healing; and all is
tenderness of love. And grace worketh: raising, rewarding,
endlessly overpassing that which our longing
and our travail deserveth, spreading abroad and shewing
the high plenteous largess<a name="FNanchor_5_193" id="FNanchor_5_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_193" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of God's royal Lordship in
His marvellous courtesy; and this is of the abundance
of love. For grace worketh our dreadful failing into
plenteous, endless solace; and grace worketh our shameful
falling into high, worshipful rising; and grace
worketh our sorrowful dying into holy, blissful life.</p>

<p>For I saw full surely that ever as our contrariness
worketh to us here in earth pain, shame, and sorrow,
right so, on the contrary wise, grace worketh to us in
heaven solace, worship, and bliss; and overpassing.
And so far forth, that when we come up and receive
the sweet reward which grace hath wrought for us, then
we shall thank and bless our Lord, endlessly rejoicing
that ever we suffered woe. And that shall be for a
property of blessed love that we shall know in God
which we could never have known without woe going
before.</p>

<p>And when I saw all this, it behoved me needs to grant
that the mercy of God and the forgiveness is to slacken
and waste <i>our</i> wrath.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"Where our Lord appeareth, peace is taken, and wrath hath
no place." "Immediately is the soul made at one with God
when it is truly set at peace in itself"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>For this was an high marvel to the soul which was
continually shewed in all the Revelations, and was
with great diligence beholden, that our Lord God, anent
Himself may not forgive, for He may not be wroth: it
were impossible. For this was shewed: that our life is
all grounded and rooted in love, and without love we
may not live; and therefore to the soul that of His
special grace seeth so far into the high, marvellous
Goodness of God, and seeth that we are endlessly oned
to Him in love, it is the most impossible that may be,
that God should be wroth. For wrath and friendship
be two contraries. For He that wasteth and destroyeth
our wrath and maketh us meek and mild,&mdash;it behoveth
needs to be that He [Himself] be ever one in love, meek
and mild: which is contrary to wrath.</p>

<p>For I saw full surely that where our Lord appeareth,
peace is taken and wrath hath no place. For I saw no
manner of wrath in God, neither for short time nor for
long;&mdash;for in sooth, as to my sight, if God might be
wroth for an instant,<a name="FNanchor_1_194" id="FNanchor_1_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_194" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we should never have life nor
place nor being. For as verily as we have our being
of the endless Might of God and of the endless Wisdom
and of the endless Goodness, so verily we have our
keeping in the endless Might of God, in the endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Wisdom, and in the endless Goodness. For though we
feel in ourselves, [frail] wretches, debates and strifes,
yet are we all-mannerful enclosed in the mildness of
God and in His meekness, in His benignity and in His
graciousness.<a name="FNanchor_2_195" id="FNanchor_2_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_195" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For I saw full surely that all our endless
friendship, our place, our life and our being, is in
God.</p>

<p>For that same endless Goodness that keepeth us when
we sin, that we perish not, the same endless Goodness
continually treateth in us a peace against our wrath and
our contrarious falling, and maketh us to see our need
with a true dread, and mightily to seek unto God to
have forgiveness, with a gracious desire of our salvation.
And though we, by the wrath and the contrariness that is
in us, be now in tribulation, distress, and woe, as falleth
to our blindness and frailty, yet are we <i>securely</i> safe by
the merciful keeping of God, that we perish not. But
we are not <i>blissfully</i> safe, in having of our endless joy,
till we be all in peace and in love: that is to say, full
pleased with God and with all His works, and with all
His judgments, and loving and peaceable with our self
and with our even-Christians and with all that God
loveth, as love beseemeth.<a name="FNanchor_3_196" id="FNanchor_3_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_196" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And this doeth God's
Goodness in us.</p>

<p>Thus saw I that God is our very Peace, and He is our
sure Keeper when we are ourselves in unpeace, and He
continually worketh to bring us into endless peace.
And thus when we, by the working of mercy and grace,
be made meek and mild, we are fully safe; suddenly is
the soul oned to God when it is truly peaced in itself:
for in Him is found no wrath. And thus I saw when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
we are all in peace and in love, we find no contrariness,
nor no manner of letting through that contrariness which
is now in us; [nay], our Lord of His Goodness maketh it
to us full profitable. For that contrariness is cause of
our tribulations and all our woe, and our Lord Jesus
taketh them and sendeth them up to Heaven, and there
are they made more sweet and delectable than heart may
think or tongue may tell. And when we come thither
we shall find them ready, all turned into very fair and
endless worships. Thus is God our steadfast Ground:
and He shall be our full bliss and make us unchangeable,
as He is, when we are there.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"The blame of our sin continually hangeth upon us." "In the
sight of God the soul that shall be saved was never dead, nor
ever shall be dead"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And in this life mercy and forgiveness is our way and
evermore leadeth us to grace. And by the tempest
and the sorrow that we fall into on our part, we be often
dead as to man's doom in earth; but in the sight of God
the soul that shall be saved was never dead, nor ever
shall be.</p>

<p>But yet here I wondered and marvelled with all the
diligence of my soul, saying thus within me: <i>Good Lord, I
see Thee that art very Truth; and I know in truth<a name="FNanchor_1_197" id="FNanchor_1_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_197" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that we
sin grievously every day and be much blameworthy; and I may
neither leave the knowing of Thy truth,<a name="FNanchor_2_198" id="FNanchor_2_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_198" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> nor do I see Thee shew
to us any manner of blame. How may this be?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>For I knew by the common teaching of Holy Church
and by mine own feeling, that the blame of our sin
continually hangeth upon us, from the first man unto
the time that we come up unto heaven: then was this
my marvel that I saw our Lord God shewing to us no
more blame than if we were as clean and as holy as
Angels be in heaven. And between these two contraries
my reason was greatly travailed through my blindness,
and could have no rest for dread that His blessed
presence should pass from my sight and I be left in
unknowing [of] how He beholdeth us in our sin. For
either [it] behoved me to see in God that sin was all
done away, or else me behoved to see in God how He
seeth it, whereby I might truly know how it belongeth
to me to see sin, and the manner of our blame. My
longing endured, Him continually beholding;&mdash;and yet
I could have no patience for great straits<a name="FNanchor_3_199" id="FNanchor_3_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_199" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and perplexity,
thinking: <i>If I take it thus that we be no sinners and not
blameworthy, it seemeth as I should err and fail of knowing
of this truth<a name="FNanchor_4_200" id="FNanchor_4_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_200" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; and if it be so that we be sinners and blameworthy,&mdash;Good
Lord, how may it then be that I cannot see
this true thing<a name="FNanchor_5_201" id="FNanchor_5_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_201" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in Thee, which art my God, my Maker, in
whom I desire to see all truths?</i><a name="FNanchor_6_202" id="FNanchor_6_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_202" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>For three points make me hardy to ask it. The first
is, because it is so low a thing: for if it were an high
thing I should be a-dread. The second is, that it is so
common: for if it were special and privy, also I should
be a-dread. The third is, that it needeth me to know it
(as methinketh) if I shall live here for knowing of good
and evil, whereby I may, by reason and grace, the more
dispart them asunder, and love goodness and hate evil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
as Holy Church teacheth. I cried inwardly, with all my
might seeking unto God for help, saying thus: <i>Ah!
Lord Jesus, King of bliss, how shall I be eased? Who shall
teach me and tell me that [thing] me needeth to know, if I may
not at this time see it in Thee?</i></p>

own Son, precious and worthy Christ"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And then our Courteous Lord answered in shewing
full mistily a wonderful example of a Lord that
hath a Servant: and He gave me sight to my understanding
of both. Which sight was shewed doubly in
the Lord and doubly in the Servant: the one part was
shewed spiritually in bodily likeness, and the other part
was shewed more spiritually, without bodily likeness.</p>

<p>For the first [sight], thus, I saw two persons in bodily
likeness: that is to say, a Lord and a Servant; and
therewith God gave me spiritual understanding. The
Lord sitteth stately in rest and in peace; the Servant
standeth by afore his Lord reverently, ready to do his
Lord's will. The Lord looketh upon his Servant full
lovingly and sweetly, and meekly he sendeth him to a
certain place to do his will. The Servant not only he
goeth, but suddenly he starteth, and runneth in great
haste, for love to do his Lord's will. And anon he
falleth into a slade,<a name="FNanchor_1_203" id="FNanchor_1_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_203" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and taketh full great hurt. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
then he groaneth and moaneth and waileth and struggleth,
but he neither may rise nor help himself by no manner
of way.</p>

<p>And of all this the most mischief<a name="FNanchor_2_204" id="FNanchor_2_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_204" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that I saw him in,
was failing of comfort: for he could not turn his face to
look upon his loving Lord, which was to him full near,&mdash;in
Whom is full comfort;&mdash;but as a man that was
feeble and unwise for the time, he turned his mind<a name="FNanchor_3_205" id="FNanchor_3_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_205" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to
his feeling and endured in woe.</p>

<p>In which woe he suffered seven great pains. The
first was the sore bruising that he took in his falling,
which was to him feelable pain; the second was the
heaviness of his body; the third was feebleness following
from these two; the fourth, that he was blinded in his
reason and stunned in his mind, so far forth that almost
he had forgotten his own love; the fifth was that he
might not rise; the sixth was most marvellous to me,
and that was that he lay all alone: I looked all about
and beheld, and far nor near, high nor low, I saw to him
no help; the seventh was that the place which he lay on
was a long, hard, and grievous [place].</p>

<p>I marvelled how this Servant might meekly suffer
there all this woe, and I beheld with carefulness to learn
if I could perceive in him any fault, or if the Lord
should assign to him any blame. And in sooth there
was none seen: for only his goodwill and his great
desire was cause of his falling; and he was unlothful,
and as good inwardly as when he stood afore his Lord,
ready to do his will. And right thus continually his
loving Lord full tenderly beholdeth him. But now with
a <i>double</i> manner of Regard: one outward, full meekly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and mildly, with great ruth and pity,&mdash;and this was of the
first [sight], another <i>inward,</i> more spiritually,&mdash;and this
was shewed with a leading of mine understanding into
the Lord, [in the] which I saw Him highly rejoicing for
the worshipful restoring that He will and shall bring
His Servant to by His plenteous grace; and this was of
that other shewing.</p>

<p>And now [was] my understanding led again into the
first [sight]; both keeping in mind. Then saith this
courteous Lord in his meaning: <i>Lo, lo, my loved Servant,
what harm and distress he hath taken in my service for my
love,&mdash;yea, and for his goodwill. Is it not fitting that I award
him [for] his affright and his dread, his hurt and his maim and
all his woe? And not only this, but falleth it not to me to give
a gift that [shall] be better to him, and more worshipful, than
his own wholeness should have been?&mdash;or else methinketh I
should do him no grace.</i></p>

<p>And in this an inward spiritual Shewing of the Lord's
meaning descended into my soul: in which I saw that it
behoveth needs to be, by virtue of His great [Goodness]
and His own worship, that His dearworthy Servant,
which He loved so much, should be verily and blissfully
rewarded, above that he should have been if he had not
fallen. Yea, and so far forth, that his falling and his
woe, that he hath taken thereby, shall be turned into
high and overpassing worship and endless bliss.</p>

<p>And at this point the shewing of the example vanished,
and our good Lord led forth mine understanding in sight
and in shewing of the Revelation to the end. But notwithstanding
all this forth-leading, the marvelling over
the example went never from me: for methought it was
given me for an answer to my desire, and yet could I not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
take therein full understanding to mine ease at that time.
For in the Servant that was shewed for Adam, as I shall
tell, I saw many diverse properties that might in no
manner of way be assigned<a name="FNanchor_4_206" id="FNanchor_4_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_206" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to single Adam. And thus
in that time I stood for much part in unknowing: for the
full understanding of this marvellous example was not
given me in that time. In which mighty example three
properties of the Revelation be yet greatly hid; and notwithstanding
this [further forthleading], I saw and understood
that every Shewing is full of secret things [left hid].</p>

<p>And therefore me behoveth now to tell three properties
in which I am somewhat eased. The first is the
beginning of teaching that I understood therein, in the
same time; the second is the inward teaching that I have
understood therein afterward; the third, all the whole
Revelation from the beginning to the end (that is to say
of this Book) which our Lord God of His goodness
bringeth oftentimes freely to the sight of mine understanding.
And these three are so oned, as to my understanding,
that I cannot, nor may, dispart them. And by
these three, as one, I have teaching whereby I ought to
believe and trust in our Lord God, that of the same
goodness of which He shewed it, and for the same end,
right so, of the same goodness and for the same end He
shall declare it to us when it is His will.</p>

<p>For, twenty years after the time of the Shewing, save
three months, I had teaching inwardly, as I shall tell:
<i>It belongeth to thee to take heed to all the properties and conditions
that were shewed in the example, though thou think that
they be misty and indifferent<a name="FNanchor_5_207" id="FNanchor_5_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_207" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to thy sight</i>. I assented willingly,
with great desire, and inwardly [beheld] with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
heedfulness<a name="FNanchor_6_208" id="FNanchor_6_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_208" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> all the points and properties that were
shewed in the same time, as far forth as my wits and
understanding would serve: beginning my beholding at
the Lord and at the Servant, and the manner of sitting
of the Lord, and the place that he sat on, and the colour
of his clothing and the manner of shape, and his countenance
without, and his nobleness and his goodness within;
at the manner of standing of the Servant, and the place
where, and how; at his manner of clothing, the colour
and the shape; at his outward having and at his inward
goodness and his unloathfulness.</p>

<p>The Lord that sat stately in rest and in peace, I understood
that He is God. The Servant that stood afore the
Lord, I understood that it was shewed for Adam: that
is to say, one man was shewed, that time, and his falling,
to make it thereby understood how God beholdeth All-Man
and his falling. For in the sight of God all man is
one man, and one man is all man. This man was hurt
in his might and made full feeble; and he was stunned
in his understanding so that he [was] turned from the
beholding of his Lord. But his will was kept whole in
God's sight;&mdash;for his will I saw our Lord commend and
approve. But himself was letted and blinded from the
knowing of this will; and this is to him great sorrow
and grievous distress: for neither doth he see clearly his
loving Lord, which is to him full meek and mild, nor
doth he see truly what himself is in the sight of his
loving Lord. And well I wot when these two are wisely
and truly seen, we shall get rest and peace here in part,
and the fulness of the bliss of Heaven, by His plenteous
grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>And this was a beginning of teaching which I saw in
the same time, whereby I might come to know in what
manner He beholdeth us in our sin. And then I saw that
only Pain blameth and punisheth, and our courteous Lord
comforteth and sorroweth; and ever He is to the soul in
glad Cheer, loving, and longing to bring us to His bliss.</p>

<p>The place that the Lord sat on was simple, on the
earth, barren and desert, alone in wilderness; his clothing
was ample and full seemly, as falleth to a Lord; the
colour of his cloth was blue as azure, most sad and fair,
his cheer was merciful; the colour of his face was fair-brown,&mdash;with
full seemly features; his eyes were black,
most fair and seemly, shewing [<i>outward</i>] full of lovely
<i>pity</i>, and [shewing], <i>within</i> him, an high Regard,<a name="FNanchor_7_209" id="FNanchor_7_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_209" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> long
and broad, all full of endless heavens. And the lovely
looking wherewith He looked upon His Servant continually,&mdash;and
especially in his falling,&mdash;methought it
might melt our hearts for love and burst them in two
for joy. The fair looking shewed [itself] of a seemly
mingledness which was marvellous to behold: the one
[part] was Ruth and Pity, the other was Joy and Bliss.
The Joy and Bliss passeth as far Ruth and Pity as
Heaven is above earth: the Pity was earthly and the Bliss
was heavenly: the Ruth and Pity of the Father was [in
regard] of the falling of Adam, which is His most loved
creature; the Joy and Bliss was [in regard] of His dearworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Son, which is even with the Father. The Merciful
Beholding of His Countenance<a name="FNanchor_8_210" id="FNanchor_8_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_210" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of love fulfilled all earth
and descended down with Adam into hell, with which
continuant pity Adam was kept from endless death. And
thus Mercy and Pity dwelleth with mankind unto the
time we come up into Heaven.</p>

<p>But man is blinded in this life and therefore we may
not see our Father, God, as He is. And what time that
He of His goodness willeth to shew Himself to man, He
sheweth Himself homely, as man. Notwithstanding, I
reason, in verity<a name="FNanchor_9_211" id="FNanchor_9_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_211" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> we ought to know and believe that the
Father is not man.</p>

<p>But his sitting on the earth barren and desert, is to
signify this:&mdash;He made man's soul to be His own City
and His dwelling-place: which is most pleasing to Him
of all His works. And what time that man was fallen
into sorrow and pain, he was not all seemly to serve in
that noble office; and therefore our Lord Father would
prepare Himself no other place, but would sit upon the
earth abiding mankind, which is mingled with earth, till
what time by His grace His dearworthy Son had brought
again His City into the noble fairness with His hard
travail. The blueness of the clothing betokeneth His
steadfastness; the brownness of his fair face, with the
seemly blackness of the eyes, was most accordant to
shew His holy soberness. The length and breadth of
his garments, which were fair, flaming about, betokeneth
that He hath, beclosed in Him, all Heavens, and all Joy
and Bliss:<a name="FNanchor_10_212" id="FNanchor_10_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_212" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and this was shewed in a touch [of time],
where I have said: <i>Mine understanding was led into the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
<i>Lord</i>; in which [inward shewing] I saw Him highly
<i>rejoice</i> for the worshipful restoring that He will and shall
bring His servant to by His plenteous grace.</p>

<p>And yet I marvelled, beholding the Lord and the
Servant aforesaid. I saw the Lord sit stately, and
the Servant standing reverently afore his Lord. In
which Servant there is double understanding, one <i>without</i>,
another <i>within. Outwardly</i>:&mdash;he was clad simply,
as a labourer which were got ready for his toil;<a name="FNanchor_11_213" id="FNanchor_11_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_213" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
he stood full near the Lord&mdash;not evenly in front<a name="FNanchor_12_214" id="FNanchor_12_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_214" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of
him, but in part to one side, on the left. His clothing
was a white kirtle, single, old, and all defaced, dyed
with sweat of his body, strait-fitting to him, and short&mdash;as
it were an handful beneath the knee; [thread]bare,
seeming as it should soon be worn out, ready to be
ragged and rent. And of this I marvelled greatly,
thinking: this is now an unseemly clothing for the
Servant that is so greatly loved to stand in afore so worshipful
a Lord. And <i>inwardly</i> in him was shewed a
ground of love: which love that he had to the Lord was
even-like<a name="FNanchor_13_215" id="FNanchor_13_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_215" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to the love that the Lord had to him.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the Servant saw inwardly that there
was one thing to do which should be to the worship of
the Lord. And the Servant, for love, having no regard
to himself nor to nothing that might befall him, hastily
he started and ran at the sending of his Lord, to do that
thing which was his will and his worship. For it
seemed by his outward clothing as he had been a continuant
labourer of long time, and by the <i>inward sight</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that I had both of the Lord and the Servant it seemed
that he was a<a name="FNanchor_14_216" id="FNanchor_14_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_216" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> new [one], that is to say, new beginning
to travail: which Servant was never sent out afore.</p>

<p>There was a treasure in the earth which the Lord
loved. I marvelled and thought what it might be, and
I was answered in mine understanding: <i>It is a food which
is delectable and pleasant to the Lord</i>. For I saw the Lord
sit as a man, and I saw neither meat nor drink wherewith
to serve him. This was one marvel. Another
marvel was that this majestic Lord had no servant but
one, and him he sent out. I beheld, thinking what
manner of labour it might be that the Servant should do.
And then I understood that he should do the greatest
labour and hardest travail: that is, he should be a
gardener, delve and dyke, toil and sweat, and turn the
earth upside-down, and seek the deepness, and water
the plants in time. And in this he should continue his
travail and make sweet floods to run, and noble and
plenteous fruits to spring, which he should bring afore
the Lord to serve him therewith to his desire. And he
should never turn again till he had prepared this food all
ready as he knew that it pleased the Lord. And then
he should take this food, with the drink in the food, and
bear it full worshipfully afore the Lord. And all this
time the Lord should sit in the same place, abiding his
Servant whom he sent out.</p>

<p>And yet I marvelled from whence the Servant came.
For I saw in the Lord that HE hath within Himself endless
life, and all manner of goodness, save that treasure
that was in the earth. And [also] <i>that</i> [treasure] was
grounded in the Lord in marvellous deepness of endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
love, but it was not all to His worship till the Servant
had thus nobly prepared it, and brought it before Him in
himself present. And without the Lord was nothing but
wilderness. And I understood not all what this example
meant, and therefore I marvelled whence the Servant
came.</p>

<p>In the Servant is comprehended the Second Person in
the Trinity; and in the Servant is comprehended Adam:
that is to say, All-Man. And therefore when I say the
<i>Son</i>, it meaneth the Godhead which is even with the
Father; and when I say the <i>Servant</i>, it meaneth Christ's
Manhood, which is rightful Adam. By the nearness
of the Servant is understood the Son, and by the
standing on the left side is understood Adam. The
Lord is the Father, God; the Servant is the Son, Christ
Jesus; the Holy Ghost is Even<a name="FNanchor_15_217" id="FNanchor_15_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_217" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Love which is in them
both.</p>

<p>When Adam fell, God's Son fell: because of the
rightful oneing which had been made in heaven, God's
Son might not [be disparted] from Adam. (For by
Adam I understand All-Man.) Adam fell from life to
death, into the deep<a name="FNanchor_16_218" id="FNanchor_16_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_218" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of this wretched world, and after
that into hell: God's Son fell with Adam, into the deep<a name="FNanchor_17_219" id="FNanchor_17_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_219" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
of the Maiden's womb, who was the fairest daughter of
Adam; and for this end: to excuse Adam from blame
in heaven and in earth; and mightily He fetched him out
of hell.</p>

<p>By the wisdom and goodness that was in the Servant
is understood God's Son; by the poor clothing as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
labourer standing near the left side, is understood the
Manhood and Adam, with all the scathe<a name="FNanchor_18_220" id="FNanchor_18_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_220" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and feebleness
that followeth. For in all this our good Lord shewed
His own Son and Adam but <i>one</i> Man. The virtue and
the goodness that we have is of Jesus Christ, the feebleness
and the blindness that we have is of Adam: which
two were shewed in the Servant.</p>

<p>And thus hath our good Lord Jesus taken upon Him all
our blame, and therefore our Father nor may nor will
more blame assign to us than to His own Son, dearworthy
Christ. Thus was He, the Servant, afore His coming
into earth standing ready afore the Father in purpose,
till what time He would send Him to do that worshipful
deed by which mankind was brought again into heaven;&mdash;that
is to say, notwithstanding that He is God, even with
the Father as anent the Godhead. But in His foreseeing
purpose that He would be Man, to save man in fulfilling
of His Father's will, so He stood afore His Father as
a Servant, willingly<a name="FNanchor_19_221" id="FNanchor_19_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_221" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> taking upon Him all our charge.
And then He started full readily at the Father's will, and
anon He fell full low, into the Maiden's womb, having
no regard to Himself nor to His hard pains.</p>

<p>The white kirtle is the flesh; the singleness is that
there was right nought atwix the Godhead and Manhood;
the straitness is poverty; the eld is of Adam's wearing;
the defacing, of sweat of Adam's travail; the shortness
sheweth the Servant's labour.</p>

<p>And thus I saw the Son saying in His meaning<a name="FNanchor_20_222" id="FNanchor_20_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_222" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>:
<i>Lo! my dear Father, I stand before Thee in Adam's kirtle, all</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<i>ready to start and to run: I would be in the earth to do Thy
worship when it is Thy will to send me. How long shall
I desire?</i> Full soothfastly wist the Son when it would
be the Father's will and how long He should desire: that
is to say, [He wist it] anent the Godhead: for He is the
Wisdom of the Father; wherefore this question was
shewed with understanding of the <i>Manhood</i> of Christ.
For all mankind that shall be saved by the sweet Incarnation
and blissful Passion of Christ, all is the Manhood
of Christ: for He is the Head and we be His members.
To which members the day and the time is unknown
when every passing woe and sorrow shall have an end,
and the everlasting joy and bliss shall be fulfilled; which
day and time for to see, all the Company of Heaven
longeth. And all that shall be under heaven that shall
come thither, their way is by longing and desire. Which
desire and longing was shewed in the Servant's standing
afore the Lord,&mdash;or else thus in the Son's standing afore
the Father in Adam's kirtle. For the longing<a name="FNanchor_21_223" id="FNanchor_21_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_223" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
desire of all Mankind that shall be saved appeared in
Jesus: for Jesus is All that shall be saved, and All that
shall be saved is Jesus. And all of the Charity of God;
with obedience, meekness, and patience, and virtues that
belong to us.</p>

<p>Also in this marvellous example I have teaching with
me as it were the beginning of an A.B.C., whereby I
have some understanding of our Lord's meaning. For
the secret things of the Revelation be hid therein;&mdash;notwithstanding
that <i>all</i> the Shewings are full of secret
things. The <i>sitting</i> of the Father betokeneth His Godhead:
that is to say, by shewing of rest and peace: for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in the Godhead may be no travail.<a name="FNanchor_22_224" id="FNanchor_22_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_224" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And that He shewed
Himself as <i>Lord</i>, betokeneth His [governance] to our
manhood. The <i>standing</i> of the Servant betokeneth
travail; <i>on one side</i>, and on the <i>left</i>, betokeneth that he
was not all worthy to stand even-right afore the Lord;
his <i>starting</i> was the Godhead, and the <i>running</i> was the
Manhood: for the Godhead started from the Father into
the Maiden's womb, falling into the taking of our Kind.
And in this falling he took great sore: the <i>sore</i> that He
took was our flesh, in which He had also swiftly feeling
of deadly pains. That he stood <i>adread</i> before the
Lord and not even-right, betokeneth that His clothing
was not seemly<a name="FNanchor_23_225" id="FNanchor_23_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_225" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to stand in even-right afore the Lord,
nor <i>that</i> might not, nor should not, be His office
while He was a labourer; nor also He might not sit in
rest and peace with the Lord till He had won His peace
rightfully with His hard travail; and that he stood by
the <i>left</i> side [betokeneth] that the Father left His own
Son, willingly,<a name="FNanchor_24_226" id="FNanchor_24_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_226" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in the Manhood to suffer all man's pains,
without sparing of Him. By that <i>his kirtle was in point
to be ragged and rent</i>, is understood the blows, the
scourgings, the thorns and the nails, the drawing and
the dragging, His tender flesh rending. (As I saw in
some part [before] how the flesh was rent from the skull,
falling in pieces until the time when the bleeding ceased,
and then it began to dry again, cleaving to the bone.)
And by the <i>struggling and writhing, groaning and moaning,</i> is
understood that He might never rise almightily from the
time that He was fallen into the Maiden's womb, till his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
body was slain and dead, He yielding the soul into the
Father's hands with all Mankind for whom He was sent.</p>

<p>And at this point He began first to shew His might:
for He went into Hell, and when He was there He raised
up the great Root out of the deep deepness which
rightfully was knit to Him in high Heaven. The body
was in the grave till Easter-morrow, and from that time
He lay nevermore. For then was rightfully ended the
struggling and the writhing, the groaning and the moaning.
And our foul deadly flesh that God's Son took on
Him, which was Adam's old kirtle, strait, [worn]-bare,
and short, was then by our Saviour made fair, new,
white and bright and of endless cleanness; loose and
long<a name="FNanchor_25_227" id="FNanchor_25_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_227" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>; fairer and richer than was then the clothing
which [before] I saw on the Father: for that clothing
was blue, but Christ's clothing is [coloured] now of a
fair seemly medlour, which is so marvellous that I can it
not describe: for it is all of very worships.</p>

<p>Now sitteth not the Son on earth in wilderness, but
He sitteth in His noblest Seat, which He made in
Heaven most to His pleasing. Now standeth not the
Son afore the Father as a Servant afore the Lord dreadingly,
meanly clad, in part naked; but He standeth
afore the Father even-right, richly clad in blissful largeness,
with a Crown upon His head of precious richness.
For it was shewed that <i>we be His Crown</i>: which Crown
is the Joy of the Father, the Worship of the Son, the
Satisfying of the Holy Ghost, and endless marvellous
Bliss to all that be in Heaven. Now standeth not the
Son afore the Father on the left side, as a labourer,
but He sitteth on His Father's right hand, in endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
rest and peace.<a name="FNanchor_26_228" id="FNanchor_26_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_228" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (But it is not meant that the Son
sitteth on the right hand, side by side, as one man
sitteth by another in this life,&mdash;for there is no such
sitting, as to my sight, in the Trinity,&mdash;but He sitteth
on His Father's right hand,&mdash;that is to say: in the
highest nobleness of the Father's joys.) Now is the
Spouse, God's Son, in peace with His loved Wife,
which is the Fair Maiden of endless Joy. Now sitteth
the Son, Very God and Man, in His City in rest and
peace: which [City] His Father hath adight to Him of
His endless purpose; and the Father in the Son; and
the Holy Ghost in the Father and in the Son.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_209" id="Footnote_7_209"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_209"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> MS. "within him an <i>heyward</i> long and brode, all full of endless
hevyns." Cressy and Collins transcribe this word without explanation,
but give "heavenliness" for "heavens." It seems most likely
that "hey" has been written as if affixed to "ward" (<i>i.e. "regard,"
"deeming,"</i> or <i>"reward"</i>), or else to <i>"reward,"</i> meaning, as usual,
<i>regard</i> ("Beholding"). See pp. <a href="#Page_108">108</a> and <a href="#Page_113">113</a>.
</p>
<p>
If "<i>an heyward</i>"&mdash;"long and brode all full of endless hevyns,"&mdash;were
to be rendered as "an high reward," revealed for the
future along with, though less clearly than, the divine pity for the pains
of the present, reference might be made to Revelation ix. pp. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, <a href="#Page_50">50</a>:
"It is a joy, a bliss, an endless satisfying to me that ever suffered
Passion for thee." ... "In this feeling mine understanding was lifted
up into Heaven: and there I saw three heavens"; and to Rev. x. p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>:
"then with a glad Cheer our Lord looked into His Side and beheld,
rejoicing. With His sweet looking He led forth the understanding of
His creature by the same wound into His Side within. And then He
shewed a fair delectable place, and large enough for all mankind that
shall be saved to rest in peace and in love."
</p>
<p>
But "Regard" (scope of true, continuing, divine Sight, Insight,
All-comprehending sight) seems more likely to be the true rendering.
"Long and broad" go strangely with the word, but on p. <a href="#Page_113">113</a> the
<i>length and breadth</i> of the garments is interpreted immediately after the
colour of the eyes, and is said to betoken that "He hath in Him, all
Heavens, and all Joy and Bliss," and indeed these words but fill out
the idea of the more frequently used "high" to signify the "enclosing"
of "endless heavens:" that Sphere of "fulness" which is infinite.
With this passage may be compared one below, on p. <a href="#Page_113">113</a>: "The
Merciful Beholding of His loving Cheer fulfilled all earth and descended
down with Adam into hell, ... and thus Mercy and Pity
dwelleth with mankind unto the time we come up into Heaven." The
other, the Inward, the <i>high</i> Beholding or Regard it not said to "fill"
Heaven, but to be "full of" endless Heavens. So elsewhere it is said
that in our <i>Sense-soul</i>, the lower part of human nature, <i>God dwells</i>, but
that our <i>Substance</i>, the higher part, <i>dwells in God</i>. (The regard of Mercy
and Pity is with the Sense-soul; the high Regard of Joy and Bliss is with
the Substance.) P. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>, chap. lv.: "I saw that our Substance is in God,
and also I saw that in our Sense-soul God is." lvi. p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>:" The worshipful
City that our Lord Jesus sitteth in, it is our Sense-part, in
which He is enclosed; and our Nature-Substance is beclosed in Jesus,
with the blessed Soul of Christ sitting in rest in the Godhead."</p></div>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"We have now matter of mourning: for our sin is cause of
Christ's pains; and we have, lastingly, matter of joy: for endless
love made Him to suffer"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And thus I saw that God rejoiceth that He is our
Father, and God rejoiceth that He is our Mother,
and God rejoiceth that He is our Very Spouse and our
soul is His loved Wife. And Christ rejoiceth that He is
our Brother, and Jesus rejoiceth that He is our Saviour.
These are five high joys, as I understand, in which He
willeth that we enjoy; Him praising, Him thanking, Him
loving, Him endlessly blessing.</p>

<p>All that shall be saved, we have in us, for the time of
this life, a marvellous mingling<a name="FNanchor_1_229" id="FNanchor_1_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_229" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> both of weal and woe:
we have in us our Lord Jesus uprisen, we have in us the
wretchedness and the mischief of Adam's falling, dying.
By Christ we are steadfastly kept, and by His grace
touching us we are raised into sure trust of salvation.
And by Adam's falling we are so broken, in our feeling,
in diverse manners by sins and by sundry pains, in which
we are made dark, that scarsely we can take any comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
But in our intent<a name="FNanchor_2_230" id="FNanchor_2_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_230" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> we abide in God, and faithfully trust
to have mercy and grace; and this is His own working
in us. And of His goodness He openeth the eye of our
understanding, by which we have sight, sometime more
and sometime less, according as God giveth ability to receive.
And now we are raised into the one, and now
we are suffered to fall into the other.</p>

<p>And thus is this medley so marvellous in us that
scarsely we know of our self or of our even-Christian
in what way we stand, for the marvellousness of this
sundry feeling. But that same Holy Assent, <i>that</i> we
assent to God when we feel Him, truly setting our will
to be with Him, with all our heart, and with all our soul,
and with all our might. And then we hate and despise
our evil stirrings and all that might be occasion of sin,
spiritual and bodily.<a name="FNanchor_3_231" id="FNanchor_3_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_231" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And yet nevertheless when this
sweetness is hid, we fall again into blindness, and so into
woe and tribulation in diverse manners. But then is this
our comfort, that we <i>know in our faith</i> that by virtue of
Christ which is our Keeper, we assent never thereto, but
we groan there-against, and dure on, in pain and woe,
praying, unto that time that He sheweth Him again
to us.</p>

<p>And thus we stand in this medley all the days of our
life. But He willeth that we trust that He is lastingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
with as. And that in three manner.&mdash;He is with us in
Heaven, very Man, in His own Person, us updrawing;
and that was shewed in [the Shewing of] the Spiritual
Thirst. And He is with us in earth, us leading; and
that was shewed in the Third [Shewing], where I saw
God in a Point. And He is with us in our soul, endlessly
dwelling, us ruling and keeping; and that was
shewed in the Sixteenth [Shewing], as I shall tell.</p>

<p>And thus in the Servant was shewed the scathe and
blindness of Adam's falling; and in the Servant was
shewed the wisdom and goodness of God's Son. And
in the Lord was shewed the ruth and pity of Adam's
woe, and in the Lord was shewed the high nobility and
the endless worship that Mankind is come to by the
virtue of the Passion and death of His dearworthy Son.
And therefore mightily He joyeth in his falling for the
high raising and fulness of bliss that Mankind is come
to, overpassing that we should have had if he had not
fallen.&mdash;And thus to see this overpassing nobleness was
mine understanding led into God in the same time that I
saw the Servant fall.</p>

<p>And thus we have, now, matter of mourning: for our
sin is cause of Christ's pains; and we have, lastingly,
matter of joy: for endless love made Him to suffer. And
therefore the creature that seeth and feeleth the working
of love by grace, hateth nought but sin: for of all things,
to my sight, love and hate are [the] hardest and most unmeasureable
contraries. And notwithstanding all this, I
saw and understood in our Lord's meaning that we may
not in this life keep us from sin as wholly in full cleanness
as we shall be in Heaven. But we may well by
grace keep us from the sins which would lead us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
endless pains, as Holy Church teacheth us; and eschew
venial [ones] reasonably up to our might. And if we by
our blindness and our wretchedness any time fall, we
should readily rise, knowing the sweet touching of grace,
and with all our will amend us upon the teaching of Holy
Church, according as the sin is grievous, and go forthwith
to God in love; and neither, on the one side, fall
over low, inclining to despair, nor, on the other side, be
over-reckless, as if we made no matter of it<a name="FNanchor_4_232" id="FNanchor_4_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_232" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; but nakedly
acknowledge our feebleness, finding that we may not
stand a twinkling of an eye but by Keeping of grace, and
reverently cleave to God, on Him only trusting.</p>

<p>For after one wise is the Beholding by<a name="FNanchor_5_233" id="FNanchor_5_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_233" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> God, and
after another wise is the Beholding by<a name="FNanchor_6_234" id="FNanchor_6_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_234" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> man. For it
belongeth to man meekly to accuse himself, and it belongeth
to the proper Goodness of our Lord God courteously
to excuse man. And these be two parts that were
shewed in the double Manner of Regard with which the
Lord beheld the falling of His loved Servant. The one
was shewed outward, very meekly and mildly, with great
ruth and pity; and that of endless Love. And right thus
willeth our Lord that we accuse our self, earnestly and
truly seeing and knowing our falling and all the harms
that come thereof; seeing and learning<a name="FNanchor_7_235" id="FNanchor_7_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_235" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that we can
never restore it; and therewith that we earnestly and
truly see and know His everlasting love that He hath to
us, and His plenteous mercy. And thus graciously to
see and know both together is the meek accusing that
our Lord asketh of us, and Himself worketh it where it
is. And this is the lower part of man's life, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
shewed in the [Lord's] <i>outward</i> manner of Regard. In
which shewing I saw <i>two</i> parts: the one is the rueful
falling of man, the other is the worshipful Satisfaction<a name="FNanchor_8_236" id="FNanchor_8_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_236" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
that our Lord hath made for man.</p>

<p>The other manner of Regard was shewed <i>inward</i>:
and that was more highly and all [fully] <i>one</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_237" id="FNanchor_9_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_237" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> For the
life and the virtue that we have in the lower part is of
the higher, and it cometh down to us [from out] of the
Natural love of the [high] Self, by [the working of] grace.
Atwix [the life of] the one and [the life of] the other there is
right nought: for it is all one love. Which one blessed love
hath now, in us, double working: for in the lower part
are pains and passions, mercies and forgiveness, and such
other that are profitable; but in the higher part are none
of these, but all one high love and marvellous joy: in<a name="FNanchor_10_238" id="FNanchor_10_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_238" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
which joy all pains are highly restored. And in this
[time] our Lord showed not only our Excusing<a name="FNanchor_11_239" id="FNanchor_11_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_239" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> [from
blame, in His beholding of our higher part], but the
worshipful nobility that He shall bring us to [by the
working of grace in our lower part], turning all our
blame [that is therein, from our falling] into endless
worship [when we be oned to the high Self above].<a name="FNanchor_12_240" id="FNanchor_12_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_240" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center">"In every soul that shall be saved is a Godly Will that never
assented to sin, nor ever shall." "Ere that He made us He
loved us, and when we were made we loved Him"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And I saw that He willeth that we understand He
taketh not harder the falling of any creature that
shall be saved than He took the falling of Adam, which,
we know, was endlessly loved and securely kept in the
time of all his need, and now is blissfully restored in
high overpassing joy. For our Lord is so good, so
gentle, and so courteous, that He may never assign
default [in those] in whom He shall ever be blessed and
praised.</p>

<p>And in this that I have now told was my desire in
part answered, and my great difficulty<a name="FNanchor_1_241" id="FNanchor_1_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_241" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> some deal eased,
by the lovely, gracious Shewing of our good Lord. In
which Shewing I saw and understood full surely that in
every soul that shall be saved is a Godly Will that never
assented to sin, nor ever shall: which Will is so good
that it may never will evil, but evermore continually it
willeth good; and worketh good in the sight of God.
Therefore our Lord willeth that we know this in the
Faith and the belief; and especially that we have all
this blessed Will whole and safe in our Lord Jesus
Christ. For that same Kind<a name="FNanchor_2_242" id="FNanchor_2_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_242" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that Heaven shall be filled
with behoveth needs, of God's rightfulness, so to have
been knit and oned to Him, that therein was kept a Substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which might never, nor should, be parted from
Him; and <i>that</i> through His own Good Will in His
endless foreseeing purpose.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this rightful knitting and this
endless oneing, yet the redemption and the again-buying
of mankind is needful and speedful in everything, as it
is done for the same intent and to the same end that
Holy Church in our Faith us teacheth.</p>

<p>For I saw that God <i>began</i> never to love mankind: for
right the same that mankind shall be in endless bliss,
fulfilling the joy of God as anent His works, right so
the same, mankind hath been in the foresight of God:
known and loved from without beginning in his<a name="FNanchor_3_243" id="FNanchor_3_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_243" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> rightful
intent. By the endless assent of the full accord of
all the Trinity, the Mid-Person willed to be Ground
and Head of this fair Kind: out of Whom we be all come,
in Whom we be all enclosed, into Whom we shall all
wend,<a name="FNanchor_4_244" id="FNanchor_4_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_244" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in Him finding our full Heaven in everlasting
joy, by the foreseeing purpose of all the blessed Trinity
from without beginning.</p>

<p>For ere that He made us He loved us, and when we
were made we loved Him. And this is a Love that
is <i>made</i>, [to our Kindly Substance], [by virtue] of the
Kindly Substantial <i>Goodness</i> of the Holy Ghost; Mighty,
in Reason, [by virtue] of the <i>Might</i> of the Father; and
Wise, in Mind, [by virtue] of the <i>Wisdom</i> of the Son.
And thus is Man's Soul made by God and in the same
point knit to God.</p>

<p>And thus I understand that man's Soul is made of
nought: that is to say, it is made, but of nought that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
made. And thus:&mdash;When God should make man's body
He took the clay of earth, which is a matter mingled
and gathered of all bodily things; and thereof He made
man's body. But to the making of man's Soul He
would take right nought, but made it. And thus is the
Nature-made rightfully oned to the Maker, which is Substantial
Nature not-made: that is, God. And therefore
it is that there may nor shall be right nought atwix God
and man's Soul.</p>

<p>And in this endless Love man's Soul is kept whole, as
the matter of the Revelations signifieth and sheweth:
in which endless Love we be led and kept of God and
never shall be lost. For He willeth we<a name="FNanchor_5_245" id="FNanchor_5_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_245" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> be aware that
our Soul is a life, which life of His Goodness and His
Grace shall last in Heaven without end, Him loving,
Him thanking, Him praising. And right the same that
we shall be without end, the same we were treasured in
God and hid, known and loved from without beginning.</p>

<p>Wherefore He would have us understand that the
noblest thing that ever He made is mankind: and the
fullest Substance and the highest Virtue is the blessed
Soul of Christ. And furthermore He would have us
understand that His<a name="FNanchor_6_246" id="FNanchor_6_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_246" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> dear worthy Soul [of Manhood] was
preciously knit to Him in the making [by Him of Manhood's
Substantial Nature] which knot is so subtle and
so mighty that (it)<a name="FNanchor_7_247" id="FNanchor_7_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_247" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;[man's soul]&mdash;is oned into God: in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
which oneing it is made endlessly holy. Furthermore
He would have us know that all the souls that shall be
saved in Heaven without end, are knit and oned in this
oneing and made holy in this holiness.</p>

The meaning is, perhaps, that the Manhood-Substance, or Soul of
Christ, was in its making, by the Second Person in the Trinity, so
united to Himself that Man's Substance and each man's soul (in salvation),
being one with it, are one with God the Son. See li. p. <a href="#Page_117">117</a>.</p></div>

in our Lord's signifying, where the blessed Soul
of Christ is, there is the Substance of all the souls that
shall be saved by Christ.</p>

<p>Highly ought we to rejoice that God dwelleth in our
soul, and much more highly ought we to rejoice that
our soul dwelleth in God. Our soul is <i>made</i> to be God's
dwelling-place; and the dwelling-place of the soul is
God, Which is <i>unmade</i>. And high understanding it is,
inwardly to see and know that God, which is our Maker,
dwelleth in our soul; and an higher understanding it is,
inwardly to see and to know that our soul, that is made,
dwelleth in God's Substance: of which Substance, God,
we are that we are.</p>

<p>And I saw no difference between God and our Substance:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
but as it were all God; and yet mine understanding
took that our Substance is in God: that is to
say, that God is God, and our Substance is a creature in
God. For the Almighty Truth of the Trinity is our
Father: for He made us and keepeth us in Him; and
the deep Wisdom of the Trinity is our Mother, in Whom
we are all enclosed; the high Goodness of the Trinity
is our Lord, and in Him we are enclosed, and He in us.
We are enclosed in the Father, and we are enclosed in
the Son, and we are enclosed in the Holy Ghost. And
the Father is enclosed in us, and the Son is enclosed in
us, and the Holy Ghost is enclosed in us: Almightiness,
All-Wisdom, All-Goodness: one God, one Lord.</p>

<p>And our faith is a Virtue that cometh of our Nature-Substance
into our Sense-soul by the Holy Ghost; in
which all our virtues come to us: for without that, no
man may receive virtue. For it is nought else but a
right understanding, with true belief, and sure trust, of
our Being: that we are in God, and God in us, Whom
we see not. And this virtue, with all other that God
hath ordained to us coming therein, worketh in us great
things. For Christ's merciful working is in us, and we
graciously accord to Him through the gifts and the
virtues of the Holy Ghost. This working maketh that
we are Christ's children, and Christian in living.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"Christ is our Way"&mdash;"Mankind shall be restored
from double death"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And thus Christ is our Way, us surely leading in His
laws, and Christ in His body mightily beareth us
up into heaven. For I saw that Christ, us all having in
Him that shall be saved by Him, worshipfully presenteth
His Father in heaven with us; which present full thankfully
His Father receiveth, and courteously giveth it to
His Son, Jesus Christ: which gift and working is joy to
the Father, and bliss to the Son, and pleasing to the
Holy Ghost. And of all things that belong to us [to do],
it is most pleasing to our Lord that we enjoy in this joy
which is in the blessed Trinity [in virtue] of our salvation.
(And this was seen in the Ninth Shewing, where
it speaketh more of this matter.) And notwithstanding
all our feeling of woe or weal, God willeth that we
should understand and hold<a name="FNanchor_1_248" id="FNanchor_1_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_248" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by faith that we are more
verily in heaven than in earth.</p>

<p>Our Faith cometh of the natural Love of our soul, and
of the clear light of our Reason, and of the steadfast
Mind which we have from<a name="FNanchor_2_249" id="FNanchor_2_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_249" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> God in our first making.
And what time that our soul is inspired into our body,
in which we are made sensual, so soon mercy and grace
begin to work, having of us care and keeping with pity
and love: in which working the Holy Ghost formeth, in
our Faith, <i>Hope</i> that we shall come again up above to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Substance, into the Virtue of Christ, increased and fulfilled
through the Holy Ghost. Thus I understood that
the sense-soul is grounded in Nature, in Mercy, and in
Grace: which Ground enableth us to receive gifts that
lead us to endless life.</p>

<p>For I saw full assuredly that our Substance is in God,
and also I saw that in our sense-soul<a name="FNanchor_3_250" id="FNanchor_3_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_250" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> God is: for in the
self-[same] point that our Soul is made sensual, in the
self-[same] point is the City of God ordained to Him
from without beginning; into which seat He cometh, and
never shall remove [from] it. For God is never out of
the soul: in which He dwelleth blissfully without end.
And this was seen in the Sixteenth Shewing where it
saith: <i>The place that Jesus taketh in our soul, He shall never
remove [from] it</i>. And all the gifts that God may give
to creatures, He hath given to His Son Jesus for us:
which gifts He, dwelling in us, hath enclosed in Him
unto the time that we be waxen and grown,&mdash;our soul
with our body and our body with our soul, either of
them taking help of other,&mdash;till we be brought up unto
stature, as nature worketh. And then, in the ground of
nature, with working of mercy, the Holy Ghost graciously
inspireth into us gifts leading to endless life.</p>

<p>And thus was my understanding led of God to see in
Him and to understand, to perceive and to know, that
our soul is <i>made-trinity</i>, like to the unmade blissful
Trinity,<a name="FNanchor_4_251" id="FNanchor_4_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_251" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> known and loved from without beginning, and
in the making oned to the Maker, as it is aforesaid.
This sight was full sweet and marvellous to behold,
peaceable, restful, sure, and delectable.</p>

<p>And because of the worshipful oneing that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
thus made by God betwixt the soul and body, it
behoveth needs to be that mankind shall be restored
from double death: which restoring might never be
until the time that the Second Person in the Trinity had
taken the lower<a name="FNanchor_5_252" id="FNanchor_5_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_252" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> part of man's nature; to Whom the
highest<a name="FNanchor_6_253" id="FNanchor_6_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_253" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> [part] was oned in the First-making. And
these two parts were in Christ, the higher and the
lower: which is but one Soul; the higher part was one
in peace with God, in full joy and bliss; the lower part,
which is sense-nature,<a name="FNanchor_7_254" id="FNanchor_7_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_254" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> suffered for the salvation of mankind.</p>

<p>And these two parts [in Christ] were seen and felt in
the Eighth Shewing, in which my body was fulfilled
with feeling and mind of Christ's Passion and His death,
and furthermore with this was a subtile feeling and
privy inward sight of the High Part which I was
shewed in the same time when I could not, [even] for
the friendly<a name="FNanchor_8_255" id="FNanchor_8_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_255" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> proffer [made to me], look up into Heaven:
and that was because of that mighty beholding [that I
had] of the Inward Life. Which Inward Life is that
High Substance, that precious Soul, [of Christ], which
is endlessly rejoicing in the Godhead.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"God is nearer to us than our own soul"<br />
"We can never come to full knowing of God till we know
first clearly our own Soul"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And thus I saw full surely that it is readier to us to
come to the knowing of God than to know our
own Soul. For our Soul is so deep-grounded in God,
and so endlessly treasured, that we may not come to the
knowing thereof till we have first knowing of God,
which is the Maker, to whom it is oned. But, notwithstanding,
I saw that we have, for fulness, to desire
wisely and truly to know our own Soul: whereby we
are learned to seek it where it is, and that is, in God.
And thus by gracious leading of the Holy Ghost, we
should know them both in one: whether we be stirred
to know God or our Soul, both [these stirrings] are
good and true.</p>

<p>God is nearer to us than our own Soul: for He is
[the] Ground in whom our Soul standeth, and He is [the]
Mean that keepeth the Substance and the Sense-nature
together so that they shall never dispart. For our soul
sitteth in God in very rest, and our soul standeth in God
in very strength, and our Soul is kindly rooted in God in
endless love: and therefore if we will have knowledge
of our Soul, and communing and dalliance therewith, it
behoveth to seek unto our Lord God in whom it is
enclosed. (And of this enclosement I saw and understood
more in the Sixteenth Shewing, as I shall tell.)</p>

<p>And as anent our Substance and our Sense-part, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
together may rightly be called our Soul:<a name="FNanchor_1_256" id="FNanchor_1_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_256" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and that is
because of the oneing that they have in God. The
worshipful City that our Lord Jesus sitteth in is our
Sense-soul, in which He is enclosed: and our Kindly
Substance is enclosed in Jesus with the blessed Soul of
Christ sitting in rest in the Godhead.</p>

<p>And I saw full surely that it behoveth needs to be
that we should be in longing and in penance unto the
time that we be led so deep into God that we verily and
truly know our own Soul. And truly I saw that into
this high deepness our good Lord Himself leadeth us in
the same love that He made us, and in the same love
that He bought us by Mercy and Grace through virtue
of His blessed Passion. And notwithstanding all this,
we may never come to full knowing of God till we
know first clearly our own Soul. For until the time
that our Soul is in its full powers<a name="FNanchor_2_257" id="FNanchor_2_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_257" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> we cannot be all
fully holy: and that is [until the time] that our Sense-soul
by the virtue of Christ's Passion be brought up to
the Substance, with all the profits of our tribulation
that our Lord shall make us to get by Mercy and
Grace.</p>

<p>I had, in part, [experience of the] Touching [of God
in the soul], and it is grounded in Nature. That is to
say, our Reason is grounded in God, which is Substantial
Naturehood.<a name="FNanchor_3_258" id="FNanchor_3_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_258" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> [Out] of this Substantial Naturehood
Mercy and Grace springeth and spreadeth into us,
working all things in fulfilling of our joy: these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
our Ground in which we have our Increase and our
Fulfilling.</p>

<p>These be three properties in one Goodness: and
where one worketh, all work in the things which be <i>now</i>
belonging to us. God willeth that we understand [this],
desiring with all our heart to have knowing of them
more and more unto the time that we be fulfilled: for
fully to know them is nought else but endless joy and
bliss that we shall have in Heaven, which God willeth
should be begun here in knowing of His love.</p>

<p>For only by our Reason we may not profit, but if we
have evenly therewith Mind and Love: nor only in our
Nature-Ground that we have in God we may not be
saved but if we have, coming of the same Ground,
Mercy and Grace. For of these three working all
together we receive all our Goodness. Of the which
the first [gifts] are goods of Nature: for in our First
making God gave us as full goods as we might receive
in our spirit alone,<a name="FNanchor_4_259" id="FNanchor_4_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_259" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;and also greater goods; but His
foreseeing purpose in His endless wisdom willed that
we should be double.</p>

<p>And anent our Substance He made us noble, and so
rich that evermore we work His will and His worship.
(Where I say "we," it meaneth Man that shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
be saved.) For soothly I saw that we are that which
He loveth, and do that which Him pleaseth, lastingly
without any stinting: and [that by virtue] of the great
riches and of the high noble virtues by measure come to
our soul what time it is knit to our body: in which knitting
we are made Sensual.</p>

<p>And thus in our Substance we are full, and in our
Sense-soul we fail: which failing God will restore and
fulfil by working of Mercy and Grace plenteously flowing
into us out of His own Nature-Goodness.<a name="FNanchor_1_260" id="FNanchor_1_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_260" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And thus
His Nature-Goodness maketh that Mercy and Grace work
in us, and the Nature-goodness that we have of Him
enableth us to receive the working of Mercy and Grace.</p>

<p>I saw that our nature is in God whole: in which
[whole nature of Manhood] He maketh diversities flowing
out of Him to work His will: whom Nature keepeth,
and Mercy and Grace restoreth and fulfilleth. And of
these none shall perish: for our nature that is the
higher part is knit to God, in the making; and God is
knit to our nature that is the lower part, in our flesh-taking:
and thus in Christ our two natures are oned.
For the Trinity is comprehended in Christ, in whom our
higher part is grounded and rooted; and our lower part
the Second Person hath taken: which nature first to
Him was made-ready.<a name="FNanchor_2_261" id="FNanchor_2_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_261" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For I saw full surely that all
the works that God hath done, or ever shall, were fully
known to Him and aforeseen from without beginning.
And for Love He made Mankind, and for the same Love
would be Man.</p>

<p>The next<a name="FNanchor_3_262" id="FNanchor_3_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_262" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Good that we receive is our Faith, in
which our profiting beginneth. And it cometh [out] of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the high riches of our nature-Substance into our Sensual
soul, and it is grounded in us through the Nature-Goodness
of God, by the working of Mercy and Grace.
And thereof come all other goods by which we are led
and saved. For the Commandments of God come therein:
in which we ought to have two manners of understanding:
[the one is that we ought to understand and know]
which are His biddings, to love and to keep them; the
other is that we ought to know His forbiddings, to hate
and to refuse them. For in these two is all our working
comprehended. Also in our faith come the Seven Sacraments,
each following other in order as God hath ordained
them to us: and all manner of virtues.</p>

<p>For the same virtues that we have received of our
Substance, given to us in Nature by the Goodness of
God,&mdash;the same virtues by the working of Mercy are
given to us in Grace through the Holy Ghost, <i>renewed</i>:
which virtues and gifts are treasured to us in Jesus
Christ. For in that same<a name="FNanchor_4_263" id="FNanchor_4_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_263" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> time that God knitted Himself
to our body in the Virgin's womb, He took our
Sensual soul:<a name="FNanchor_5_264" id="FNanchor_5_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_264" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in which taking He, us all having
enclosed in Him, oned it to our Substance: in which
oneing He was perfect Man. For Christ having knit
in Him each<a name="FNanchor_6_265" id="FNanchor_6_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_265" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> man that shall be saved, is perfect Man.
Thus our Lady is our Mother in whom we are all
enclosed and of her born,<a name="FNanchor_7_266" id="FNanchor_7_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_266" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in Christ: (for she that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Mother of our Saviour is Mother of all that shall be
saved in our Saviour;) and our Saviour is our Very
Mother in whom we be endlessly borne,<a name="FNanchor_8_267" id="FNanchor_8_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_267" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and never shall

<p>Plenteously and fully and sweetly was this shewed, and
it is spoken of in the First, where it saith: <i>We are all in
Him enclosed and He is enclosed in us</i>. And that [enclosing
of Him in us] is spoken of in the Sixteenth Shewing,
where it saith: <i>He sitteth in our soul</i>.</p>

<p>For it is His good-pleasure to reign in our Understanding
blissfully, and sit in our Soul restfully, and to

<p>
"The soule of a man is a life consisting of three powers, <i>Memory,
Understanding,</i> and <i>Will,</i> after the image and likeness of the blessed
Trinity.... Whereby you may see, that man's soule (which may
be called a created Trinity) was in its natural state replenished in
its three powers, with the remembrance, sight, and love of the most
blessed uncreated Trinity, which is God.... But when Adam sinned,
choosing love and delight in himselfe, and in the creatures, he lost all
his excellency and dignity, and thou also in him."
</p>
<p>
Ch. III. Sec. i. "And though we should prove not to be able to
recover it fully here in this life, yet should we desire and endeavour to
recover the image and likeness of the dignity we had, so that our soul
might be reformed as it were in a shadow by grace to the image of the
Trinity which we had by nature, and hereafter shall have fully in bliss...."
Sec. ii. "Seeke then that which thou hast lost, that thou mayest
finde it; for well I wote, whosoever once hath an inward sight, but
a little of that dignity and that spirituall fairness which a soule hath
by creation, and shall have again by grace, he will loath in his heart
all the blisse, the liking, and the fairnesse of this world.... Nevertheless
as thou hast not as yet seen what it is fully, for thy spiritual
eye is not yet opened, I shall tell thee one word for all, in the which
thou shalt seeke, desire, and finde it; for in that one word is all that
thou hast lost. This word is Jesus.... If thou feelest in thy heart a great
desire to Jesus ... then seekest thou well thy Lord Jesus. And when
thou feelest this desire to God, or to Jesus (for it is all one) holpen and
comforted by a ghostly might, insomuch that it is turned into love,
affection, and spiritual fervour and sweetnesse, into light and knowing
of truth, so that for the time the point of thy thought is set upon no
other created thing, nor feeleth any stirring of vain-glory, nor of selfe-love,
nor any other evill affection (for they cannot appear at that
time) but this thy desire is onely enclosed, rested, softened, suppled,
and annoynted in Jesus, then hast thou found somewhat of Jesus; I
mean not him as he is, but a shadow of him; for the better that thou
findest him, the more shalt thou desire him. Then observe by what
manner of Prayer or Meditation or exercise of Devotion thou findest
greatest and purest desire stirred up in thee to him, and most feeling of
him, by that kind of prayer, exercise, or worke seekest thou him best,
and shalt best finde him....
</p>
<p>
"See then the mercy and courtesie of Jesus. Thou hast lost him,
but where? soothly in thy house, that is to say, in thy soul, that if
thou hadst lost all thy reason of thy soule, by its first sinne, thou
shouldst never have found him again; but he left thee thy reason, and
so he is still in thy soule, and never is quite lost out of it.
</p>
<p>
"Nevertheless, thou art never the nearer him, till thou hast found
him. He is in thee, though he be lost from thee; but thou art not in
him, till thou hast found him. This is his mercy also, that he would
suffer himself to be lost onely where he may be found, so that thou
needest not run to <i>Rome</i>, nor to <i>Jerusalem</i> to seeke him there, but turne
thy thoughts into thy owne soule, where he is hid, as the Prophet
saith; <i>Truly thou art the hidden God</i>, hid in thy soule, and seek him there.
Thus saith he himselfe in the Gospel; <i>The kingdome of heaven is likened
to a treasure hid in the field, the which when a man findeth, for joy thereof, he
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field</i>. Jesus is a treasure hid
in the soule....
</p>
<p>
"As long as Jesus findeth not his image reformed in thee, he is
strange, and the farther from thee: therefore frame and shape thyself
to be arrayed in his likenesse, that is in humility and charity, which
are his liveries, and then will he know thee, and familiarly come to
thee, and acquaint thee with his secrets. Thus saith he to his Disciples;
<i>Who so loveth me, he shall be loved of my Father, and I will manifest
my selfe unto him</i>. There is not any vertue nor any good work that
can make thee like to our Lord, without Humility and Charity, for
these two above all other are most acceptable ('most leyf') to him,
which appeareth plainly in the Gospel, where our Lord speaketh of
humility thus; <i>Learn of me, for I am meeke and humble in heart</i>. He saith
not, learn of me to go barefoot, or to go into the desart, and there to
fast forty dayes, nor yet to choose to your selves Disciples (as I did) but
learne of me meeknesse, for I am meek and lowly in heart. Also of
charity he saith thus; <i>This is my Commandment, that ye love one another as I
loved you, for by that shall men know you for my Disciples</i>. Not that you
worke miracles, or cast out Devills, or preach, or teach, but that each
one of you love one another in charity. If therefore thou wilt be like
him, have humility and charity. Now thou knowest what charity is,
<i>viz.</i> To love thy neighbour as thy selfe."
</p>
<p>
Chap. IV. Sec. 1.... "Now I shall tell thee (according to my feeble
ability) how thou mayest enter into thy selfe to see the ground of sin,
and destroy it as much as thou canst, and so recover a part of thy souls
dignity.... Draw in thy thoughts ... and set thy intent and full
purpose, as if thou wouldst not seek nor find any thing but onely the
grace and spiritual presence of Jesus."
</p>
<p>
"This will be painful; for vaine thoughts will presse into thy heart
very thick, to draw thy minde down to them. And in doing thus, thou
shalt find somewhat, but not Jesus whom thou seekest, but onely a
naked remembrance of his name. But what then shalt thou finde?
Surely this; A darke and ill-favoured image of thy owne soule, which
hath neither light of knowledge nor feeling of love of God.... This
is not the image of Jesus, but the image of sin, which St Paul calleth
a <i>body of sinne and of death</i>.... Peradventure now thou beginnest to
thinke with thy selfe what this image is like, and that thou shouldst
not study much upon it, I will tell thee. It is like no bodily thing;
What is it then saist thou? Verily it is <i>nought</i>, or no reall thing, as
thou shalt finde, if thou try by doing as I have spoken; that is, draw
in thy thoughts into thy selfe from all bodily things, and then shalt
thou find right <i>nought</i> wherein thy soule may rest.
</p>
<p>
"This <i>nothing</i> is nought else but darknesse of conscience, and a lacking
of the love of God and of light; as sin is nought but a want of good,
if it were so that the ground of sin was much abated and dryed up in
thee, and thy soule was reformed right as the image of Jesus; then if thou
didst draw into thy selfe thy heart, thou shouldst not find this <i>Nought</i>,
but thou shouldst find Jesus; not only the naked remembrance of this
name, but Jesus Christ in thy soule readily teaching thee, thou shouldst
there find light of understanding, and no darknesse of ignorance, a love
and liking of him; and no pain of bitternesse, heavinesse, or tediousenesse
of him....
</p>
<p>
"And here also thou must beware that thou take Jesus Christ into
thy thoughts against this darknesse in thy mind, by busie prayer and
fervent desire to God, not setting the point of thy thoughts on that
foresaid <i>Nought</i>, but on Jesus Christ whom thou desirest. Think
stifly on his passion, and on his Humility, and through his might thou
shalt arise. Do as if thou wouldst beate downe this darke image, and
go through-stitch with it. Thou shalt hate ('agryse') and loath this
darknesse and this <i>Nought</i>, just as the Devill, and thou shalt despise and
all to break it ('brest it').
</p>
<p>
"For within this Nought is Jesus hid in his joy, whom thou shalt
not finde with all thy seeking, unlesse thou passe this darknesse of
conscience.
</p>
<p>
"This is the ghostly travel I spake of, and the cause of all this writing
is to stir thee thereto, if thou have grace. This darknesse of conscience,
and this <i>Nought</i> is the image of the first <i>Adam</i>: St Paul knew it well,
for he said thus of it; As we have before borne the <i>image of the earthly
man</i>, that is the first <i>Adam, right so that we might now beare the image of the
heavenly man</i>, which is Jesus, the second <i>Adam</i>. St <i>Paul</i> bare this image
oft full heavily, for it was so cumbersome to him, that he cryed out of
it, saying thus; <i>O who shall deliver me from this body and this image of death</i>.
And then he comforted himselfe and others also thus: <i>The grace</i> of God
through Jesus Christ."</p></div>

<p>God, the blessed Trinity, which is everlasting Being,
right as He is endless from without beginning,
right so it was in His purpose endless, to make Mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Which fair Kind first was prepared<a name="FNanchor_1_269" id="FNanchor_1_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_269" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to His own Son, the
Second Person. And when He would, by full accord of
all the Trinity, He made us all at once; and in our
making He knit us and oned us to Himself: by which
oneing we are kept as clear and as noble as we were
made. By the virtue of the same precious oneing, we
love our Maker and seek Him, praise Him and thank
Him, and endlessly enjoy Him. And this is the work
which is wrought continually in every soul that shall be
saved: which is the Godly Will aforesaid. And thus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
our making, God, Almighty, is our Nature's Father;
and God, All-Wisdom, is our Nature's Mother; with
the Love and the Goodness of the Holy Ghost: which
is all one God, one Lord. And in the knitting and
the oneing He is our Very, True Spouse, and we His
loved Wife, His Fair Maiden: with which Wife He is
never displeased. For He saith: I love thee and thou
lovest me, and our love shall never be disparted in
two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>I beheld the working of all the blessed Trinity: in
which beholding I saw and understood these three properties:
the property of the Fatherhood, the property of
the Motherhood, and the property of the Lordhood, in
one God. In our Father Almighty we have our keeping
and our bliss as anent our natural Substance, which is
to us by our making, without beginning. And in the
Second Person in skill<a name="FNanchor_2_270" id="FNanchor_2_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_270" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and wisdom we have our keeping
as anent our Sense-soul: our restoring and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
saving; for He is our Mother, Brother, and Saviour.
And in our good Lord, the Holy Ghost, we have our
rewarding and our meed-giving for our living and our
travail, and endless overpassing of all that we desire, in
His marvellous courtesy, of His high plenteous grace.</p>

<p>For all our life is in <i>three</i>: in the first we have our
Being, in the second we have our Increasing, and in the
third we have our Fulfilling: the first is Nature, the
second is Mercy, and the third is Grace.</p>

<p>For the first, I understood that the high Might of the
Trinity is our Father, and the deep Wisdom of the
Trinity is our Mother, and the great Love of the Trinity
is our Lord: and all this have we in Nature and in the
making of our Substance.<a name="FNanchor_3_271" id="FNanchor_3_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_271" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>And furthermore I saw that the Second Person, which
is our Mother as anent the Substance, that same dearworthy
Person is become our Mother as anent the Sense-soul.
For we are double by God's making: that is to
say, Substantial and Sensual. Our Substance is the
higher part, which we have in our Father, God Almighty;
and the Second Person of the Trinity is our Mother in
Nature, in making of our Substance: in whom we are
grounded and rooted. And He is our Mother in Mercy,
in taking of our Sense-part. And thus our Mother is to
us in diverse manners working: in whom our parts are
kept undisparted. For in our Mother Christ we profit
and increase, and in Mercy He reformeth us and restoreth,
and, by the virtue of His Passion and His Death and Uprising,
oneth us to our Substance. Thus worketh our
Mother in Mercy to all His children which are to Him
yielding<a name="FNanchor_4_272" id="FNanchor_4_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_272" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and obedient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>And Grace worketh with Mercy, and specially in two
properties, as it was shewed: which working belongeth
to the Third Person, the Holy Ghost. He worketh
<i>rewarding</i> and <i>giving</i>. Rewarding is a large giving-of-truth
that the Lord doeth to him that hath travailed; and
giving is a courteous working which He doeth freely of
Grace, fulfilling and overpassing all that is deserved of
creatures.</p>

<p>Thus in our Father, God Almighty, we have our
being; and in our Mother of Mercy we have our reforming
and restoring: in whom our Parts are oned and all
made perfect Man; and by [reward]-yielding and giving
in Grace of the Holy Ghost, we are fulfilled.</p>

<p>And our Substance is [in] our Father, God Almighty,
and our Substance is [in]<a name="FNanchor_5_273" id="FNanchor_5_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_273" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> our Mother, God, All-wisdom;
and our Substance is in our Lord the Holy Ghost, God
All-goodness. For our Substance is whole in each
Person of the Trinity, which is one God. And our
Sense-soul is only in the Second Person Christ Jesus; in
whom is the Father and the Holy Ghost: and in Him
and by Him we are mightily taken out of Hell, and out
of the wretchedness in Earth worshipfully brought up
into Heaven and blissfully oned to our Substance:
increased in riches and in nobleness by all the virtues of
Christ, and by the grace and working of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"Jesus Christ that doeth Good against evil is our Very
Mother: we have our Being of Him where the Ground of
Motherhood beginneth,&mdash;with all the sweet Keeping by Love,
that endlessly followeth."<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And all this bliss we have by Mercy and Grace:
which manner of bliss we might never have had nor
known but if that property of Goodness which is God had
been contraried: whereby we have this bliss. For wickedness
hath been suffered to rise contrary to the Goodness,
and the Goodness of Mercy and Grace contraried against
the wickedness and turned all to goodness and to worship,
to all these that shall be saved. For it is the property
in God which doeth good against evil. Thus Jesus
Christ that doeth good against evil is our Very Mother:
we have our Being of Him,&mdash;where the Ground of
Motherhood beginneth,&mdash;with all the sweet Keeping of
Love that endlessly followeth. As verily as God is
our Father, so verily God is our Mother; and that
shewed He in all, and especially in these sweet words
where He saith: <i>I it am</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_274" id="FNanchor_1_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_274" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That is to say, <i>I it am, the
Might and the Goodness of the Fatherhood; I it am, the
Wisdom of the Motherhood; I it am, the Light and the Grace
that is all blessed Love: I it am, the Trinity, I it am, the
Unity: I am the sovereign Goodness of all manner of things.
I am that maketh thee to love: I am that maketh thee to long:
I it am, the endless fulfilling of all true desires.</i></p>

<p>For there the soul is highest, noblest, and worthiest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
where it is lowest, meekest, and mildest: and [out] of
this <i>Substantial Ground</i> we have all our virtues in our
Sense-part by gift of Nature, by helping and speeding of
Mercy and Grace: without the which we may not profit.</p>

<p>Our high Father, God Almighty, which is Being, He
knew and loved us from afore any time: of which knowing,
in His marvellous deep charity and the foreseeing counsel
of all the blessed Trinity, He willed that the Second
Person should become our Mother. Our Father [willeth],
our Mother worketh, our good Lord the Holy Ghost
confirmeth: and therefore it belongeth to us to love
our God in whom we have our being: Him reverently
thanking and praising for<a name="FNanchor_2_275" id="FNanchor_2_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_275" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> our making, mightily praying
to our Mother for<a name="FNanchor_3_276" id="FNanchor_3_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_276" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> mercy and pity, and to our Lord the
Holy Ghost for<a name="FNanchor_4_277" id="FNanchor_4_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_277" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> help and grace.</p>

<p>For in these three is all our life: Nature, Mercy,
Grace: whereof we have meekness and mildness;
patience and pity; and hating of sin and of wickedness,&mdash;for
it belongeth properly to virtue to hate sin and wickedness.
And thus is Jesus our Very Mother in Nature [by
virtue] of our first making; and He is our Very Mother
in Grace, by taking our nature made. All the fair
working, and all the sweet natural office of dearworthy
Motherhood is impropriated<a name="FNanchor_5_278" id="FNanchor_5_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_278" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to the Second Person: for
in Him we have this Godly Will whole and safe without
end, both in Nature and in Grace, of His own proper
Goodness. I understood three manners of beholding
of Motherhood in God: the first is grounded in our
Nature's <i>making</i>; the second is <i>taking</i> of our nature,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
there beginneth the Motherhood of Grace; the
third is Motherhood of <i>working</i>,&mdash;and therein is a forthspreading
by the same Grace, of length and breadth and
height and of deepness without end. And all is one Love.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"The Kind, loving, Mother"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>But now behoveth to say a little more of this forthspreading,
as I understand in the meaning of our
Lord: how that we be brought again by the Motherhood
of Mercy and Grace into our Nature's place,
where that we were made by the Motherhood of Nature-Love:
which kindly-love, it never leaveth us.</p>

<p>Our Kind Mother, our Gracious Mother,<a name="FNanchor_1_279" id="FNanchor_1_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_279" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for that He
would all wholly become our Mother in all things, He
took the Ground of His Works full low and full mildly
in the Maiden's womb. (And that He shewed in the
First [Shewing] where He brought that meek Maid
afore the eye of mine understanding in the simple stature
as she was when she conceived.) That is to say: our
high God is sovereign Wisdom of all: in this low place
He arrayed and dight Him full ready in our poor flesh,
Himself to do the service and the office of Motherhood
in all things.</p>

<p>The Mother's service is nearest, readiest, and surest:
[nearest, for it is most of nature; readiest, for it is most
of love; and surest]<a name="FNanchor_2_280" id="FNanchor_2_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_280" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for it is most of truth. This
office none might, nor could, nor ever should do to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
full, but He alone. We know that all our mothers'
bearing is [bearing of] us to pain and to dying: and
what is this but that our Very Mother, Jesus, He&mdash;All-Love&mdash;beareth
us to joy and to endless living?&mdash;blessed
may He be! Thus He sustaineth<a name="FNanchor_3_281" id="FNanchor_3_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_281" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> us within
Himself in love; and travailed, unto the full time that
He would suffer the sharpest throes and the most
grievous pains that ever were or ever shall be; and
died at the last. And when He had finished, and so
borne us to bliss, yet might not all this make full content
to His marvellous love; and that sheweth He in
these high overpassing words of love: <i>If I might suffer
more, I would suffer more</i>.</p>

<p>He might no more die, but He would not stint of
working: wherefore then it behoveth Him to feed us;
for the dearworthy love of Motherhood hath made Him
debtor to us. The mother may give her child suck of
her milk, but our precious Mother, Jesus, He may feed
us with Himself, and doeth it, full courteously and full
tenderly, with the Blessed Sacrament that is precious
food of my life; and with all the sweet Sacraments He
sustaineth us full mercifully and graciously. And so
meant He in this blessed word where that He said:
<i>It is I<a name="FNanchor_4_282" id="FNanchor_4_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_282" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that Holy Church preacheth thee and teacheth thee.</i>
That is to say: <i>All the health and life of Sacraments, all the
virtue and grace of my Word, all the Goodness that is ordained
in Holy Church for thee, it is I</i>. The Mother may lay the
child tenderly to her breast, but our tender Mother,
Jesus, He may homely lead us into His blessed breast,
by His sweet open side, and shew therein part of the
Godhead and the joys of Heaven, with spiritual sureness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of endless bliss. And that shewed He in the Tenth
[Shewing], giving the same understanding in this sweet
word where He saith: <i>Lo! how I loved thee</i>; looking
unto [the Wound in] His side, rejoicing.</p>

<p>This fair lovely word <i>Mother</i>, it is so sweet and so
close in Nature of itself<a name="FNanchor_5_283" id="FNanchor_5_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_283" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that it may not verily be said
of none but of <i>Him</i>; and to her that is very Mother of
Him and of all. To the property of Motherhood
belongeth natural love, wisdom, and knowing; and it is
good: for though it be so that our bodily forthbringing
be but little, low, and simple in regard of our spiritual
forthbringing, yet it is He that doeth it in the creatures
by whom that it is done. The Kindly,<a name="FNanchor_6_284" id="FNanchor_6_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_284" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> loving Mother
that witteth and knoweth the need of her child, she
keepeth it full tenderly, as the nature<a name="FNanchor_7_285" id="FNanchor_7_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_285" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and condition of
Motherhood will. And as it waxeth in age, she changeth
her working, but not her love. And when it is waxen
of more age, she suffereth that it be beaten<a name="FNanchor_8_286" id="FNanchor_8_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_286" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in breaking
down of vices, to make the child receive virtues and
graces. This working, with all that be fair and good,
our Lord doeth it in them by whom it is done: thus He
is our Mother in Nature by the working of Grace in the
lower part for love of the higher part. And He willeth
that we know this: for He will have all our love fastened
to Him. And in this I saw that all our duty that we
owe, by God's bidding, to Fatherhood and Motherhood,
for [reason of] God's Fatherhood and Motherhood is
fulfilled in true loving of God; which blessed love
Christ worketh in us. And this was shewed in all [the
Revelations] and especially in the high plenteous words
where He saith: <i>It is I that thou lovest</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"By the assay of this falling we shall have an high marvellous
knowing of Love in God, without end. For strong and
marvellous is that love which may not, nor will not, be broken
for trespass"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And in our spiritual forthbringing He useth more
tenderness of keeping, without any likeness: by
as much as our soul is of more price in His sight. He
kindleth our understanding, He directeth our ways, He
easeth our conscience, He comforteth our soul, He
lighteneth our heart, and giveth us, in part, knowing
and believing in His blissful Godhead, with gracious
mind in His sweet Manhood and His blessed Passion,
with reverent marvelling in His high, overpassing Goodness;
and maketh us to love all that He loveth, for His
love, and to be well-pleased with Him and all His works.
And when we fall, hastily He raiseth us by His lovely
calling<a name="FNanchor_1_287" id="FNanchor_1_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_287" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><a name="FNanchor_2_288" id="FNanchor_2_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_288" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and gracious touching. And when we be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
thus strengthened by His sweet working, then we with
all our will choose Him, by His sweet grace, to be His
servants and His lovers lastingly without end.</p>

<p>And after this He suffereth some of us to fall more
hard and more grievously than ever we did afore, as us
thinketh. And then ween we (who be not all wise) that
all were nought that we have begun. But this is not
so. For it needeth us to fall, and it needeth us to see
it. For if we never fell, we should not know how
feeble and how wretched we are of our self, and also we
should not fully know that marvellous love of our
Maker. For we shall see verily in heaven, without end,
that we have grievously sinned in this life, and notwithstanding
this, we shall see that we were never hurt in
His love, we were never the less of price in His sight.
And by the assay of this falling we shall have an high,
marvellous knowing of love in God, without end. For
strong and marvellous is that love which may not, nor
will not, be broken for trespass. And this is one understanding
of [our] profit. Another is the lowness and
meekness that we shall get by the sight of our falling:
for thereby we shall highly be raised in heaven; to
which raising we might<a name="FNanchor_3_289" id="FNanchor_3_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_289" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> never have come without that
meekness. And therefore it needeth us to see it; and
if we see it not, though we fell it should not profit us.
And commonly, first we fall and later we see it: and
both of the Mercy of God.</p>

<p>The mother may suffer the child to fall sometimes,
and to be hurt in diverse manners for its own profit, but
she may never suffer that any manner of peril come to the
child, for love. And though our earthly mother may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
suffer her child to perish, our heavenly Mother, Jesus,
may not suffer us that are His children to perish: for He
is All-mighty, All-wisdom, and All-love; and so is
none but He,&mdash;blessed may He be!</p>

<p>But oftentimes when our falling and our wretchedness
is shewed us, we are so sore adread, and so greatly
ashamed of our self, that scarcely we find where we may
hold us. But then willeth not our courteous Mother
that we flee away, for Him were nothing lother. But
He willeth then that we use the condition of a child: for
when it is hurt, or adread, it runneth hastily to the
mother for help, with all its might. So willeth He that
we do, as a meek child saying thus: <i>My kind Mother, my
Gracious Mother, my dearworthy Mother, have mercy on me:
I have made myself foul and unlike to Thee, and I nor may nor
can amend it but with thine help and grace</i>. And if we feel
us not then eased forthwith, be we sure that He useth
the condition of a wise mother. For if He see that it
be more profit to us to mourn and to weep, He suffereth
it, with ruth and pity, unto the best time, for love. And
He willeth then that we use the property of a child, that
evermore of nature trusteth to the love of the mother in
weal and in woe.</p>

<p>And He willeth that we take us mightily to the Faith
of Holy Church and find there our dearworthy Mother,
in solace of true Understanding, with all the blessed
Common. For one single person may oftentimes be
broken, as it seemeth to himself, but the whole Body of
Holy Church was never broken, nor never shall be,
without end. And therefore a sure thing it is, a good
and a gracious, to will meekly and mightily to be
fastened and oned to our Mother, Holy Church, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Christ Jesus. For the food of mercy that is His dearworthy
blood and precious water is plenteous to make us
fair and clean; the blessed wounds of our Saviour be
open and enjoy to heal us; the sweet, gracious hands of
our Mother be ready and diligently about us. For He
in all this working useth the office of a kind nurse that
hath nought else to do but to give heed about<a name="FNanchor_4_290" id="FNanchor_4_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_290" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the
salvation of her child.</p>

<p>It is His office to save us: it is His worship to do
[for] us,<a name="FNanchor_5_291" id="FNanchor_5_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_291" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and it is His will [that] we know it: for He
willeth that we love Him sweetly and trust in Him
meekly and mightily. And this shewed He in these
gracious words: <i>I keep thee full surely</i>.</p>

J. Morton, D.D.), p. 231: "The sixth comfort is, that our Lord, when
He suffereth us to be tempted, playeth with us, as the mother with her
young darling: she flies from him, and hides herself, and lets him sit
alone, and look anxiously around, and call <i>Dame! Dame!</i> and weep
awhile; and then she leapeth forth laughing, with outspread arms, and
embraceth and kisseth him, and wipeth his eyes. In like manner, our
Lord sometimes leaveth us alone, and withdraweth His grace, His comfort,
and His support, so that we feel no delight in any good that we do,
nor any satisfaction of heart; and yet, at that very time, our dear Father
loveth us never the less, but doth it for the great love that He hath to us."

of Mankind through the working of Grace"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>For in that time He shewed our frailty and our fallings,
our afflictings and our settings at nought,<a name="FNanchor_1_292" id="FNanchor_1_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_292" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> our

He shewed His blessed Might, His blessed Wisdom, His
blessed Love: that He keepeth us in this time as tenderly
and as sweetly to His worship, and as surely to our salvation,
as He doeth when we are in most solace and
comfort. And thereto He raiseth us spiritually and
highly in heaven, and turneth it all to His worship
and to our joy, without end. For His love suffereth us
never to lose time.</p>

<p>And all this is of the Nature-Goodness of God, by

<p style="text-align:center">"As verily as sin is unclean, so verily is it unkind"&mdash;a
disease or monstrous thing against nature. "He shall heal us
full fair."<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Here may we see that we have verily of Nature to
hate sin, and we have verily of Grace to hate sin.
For Nature is all good and fair in itself, and Grace was
sent out to save Nature and destroy sin, and bring again
fair nature to the blessed point from whence it came:
that is God; with more nobleness and worship by the
virtuous working of Grace. For it shall be seen afore
God by all His Holy in joy without end that Nature
hath been assayed in the fire of tribulation and therein
hath been found no flaw, no fault.<a name="FNanchor_1_297" id="FNanchor_1_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_297" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Thus are Nature
and Grace of one accord: for Grace is God, as Nature
is God: He is two in manner of working and one in
love; and neither of these worketh without other: they
be not disparted.</p>

<p>And when we by Mercy of God and with His help
accord us to Nature and Grace, we shall see verily that
sin is in sooth viler and more painful than hell, without
likeness: for it is contrary to our fair nature. For as
verily as sin is unclean, so verily is it unnatural,<a name="FNanchor_2_298" id="FNanchor_2_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_298" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
thus an horrible thing to see for the loved<a name="FNanchor_3_299" id="FNanchor_3_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_299" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> soul that
would be all fair and shining in the sight of God, as
Nature and Grace teacheth.</p>

<p>Yet be we not adread of this, save inasmuch as dread
may speed us: but meekly make we our moan to our
dearworthy Mother, and He shall besprinkle us in His
precious blood and make our soul full soft and full
mild, and heal us full fair by process of time, right as
it is most worship to Him and joy to us without end.
And of this sweet fair working He shall never cease nor
stint till all His dearworthy children be born and forthbrought.
(And that shewed He where He shewed
[me] understanding of the ghostly Thirst, that is the
love-longing that shall last till Doomsday.)</p>

<p>Thus in [our] Very Mother, Jesus, our life is grounded,
in the foreseeing Wisdom of Himself from without
beginning, with the high Might of the Father, the high
sovereign Goodness of the Holy Ghost. And in the
taking of our nature He quickened us; in His blessed
dying upon the Cross He bare us to endless life; and
from that time, and now, and evermore unto Doomsday,
He feedeth us and furthereth us: even as that high
sovereign Kindness of Motherhood, and as Kindly need
of Childhood asketh.</p>

<p>Fair and sweet is our Heavenly Mother in the sight
of our souls; precious and lovely are the Gracious
Children in the sight of our Heavenly Mother, with
mildness and meekness, and all the fair virtues that
belong to children in Nature. For of nature the Child
despaireth not of the Mother's love, of nature the Child
presumeth not of itself, of nature the Child loveth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Mother and each one of the other [children]. These
are the fair virtues, with all other that be like, wherewith
our Heavenly Mother is served and pleased.</p>

<p>And I understood none higher stature in this life than
Childhood, in feebleness and failing of might and of
wit, unto the time that our Gracious Mother hath
brought us up to our Father's Bliss.<a name="FNanchor_4_300" id="FNanchor_4_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_300" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And then shall it
verily be known to us His meaning in those sweet words
where He saith: <i>All shall be well: and thou shalt see,
thyself, that all manner of things shall be well</i>. And then
shall the Bliss of our Mother, in Christ, be new to begin
in the Joys of our God: which new beginning shall last
without end, new beginning.</p>

<p>Thus I understood that all His blessed children which
be come out of Him by Nature shall be brought again
into Him by Grace.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"<i>Thou shalt come up above.</i>" "A very fair creature, a little
Child&mdash;nimble and lively, whiter than lily"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Afore this time I had great longing and desire of
God's gift to be delivered of this world and of
this life. For oftentimes I beheld the woe that is here,
and the weal and the bliss that is being there: (and if
there had been no pain in this life but the absence of
our Lord, methought it was some-time more than I
might bear;) and this made me to mourn, and eagerly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
long. And also from mine own wretchedness, sloth,
and weakness, me liked not to live and to travail, as me
fell to do.</p>

<p>And to all this our courteous Lord answered for
comfort and patience, and said these words: <i>Suddenly
thou shalt be taken from all thy pain, from all thy sickness,
from all thy distress<a name="FNanchor_1_301" id="FNanchor_1_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_301" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and from all thy woe. And thou shalt
come up above and thou shalt have me to thy meed, and thou
shalt be fulfilled of love and of bliss. And thou shalt never
have no manner of pain, no manner of misliking, no wanting of
will; but ever joy and bliss without end. What should it
then aggrieve thee to suffer awhile, seeing that it is my will and
my worship?</i></p>

<p>And in this word: <i>Suddenly thou shalt be taken</i>,&mdash;I saw
that God rewardeth man for the patience that he hath in
abiding God's will, and for his time, and [for] that man
lengtheneth his patience over the time of his living.
For not-knowing of his time of passing, that is a great
profit: for if a man knew his time, he should not have
patience over that time; but, as God willeth, while the
soul is in the body it seemeth to itself that it is ever at
the point to be taken. For all this life and this languor
that we have here is but a point, and when we are
taken suddenly out of pain into bliss then pain shall be
nought.</p>

<p>And in this time I saw a body lying on the earth,
which body shewed heavy and horrible,<a name="FNanchor_2_302" id="FNanchor_2_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_302" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> without shape
and form, as it were a swollen quag of stinking mire.<a name="FNanchor_3_303" id="FNanchor_3_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_303" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
And suddenly out of this body sprang a full fair creature,
a little Child, fully shapen and formed, nimble<a name="FNanchor_4_304" id="FNanchor_4_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_304" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
lively, whiter than lily; which swiftly<a name="FNanchor_5_305" id="FNanchor_5_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_305" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> glided up into
heaven. And the swollenness of the body betokeneth
great wretchedness of our deadly flesh, and the littleness
of the Child betokeneth the cleanness of purity in
the soul. And methought: <i>With this body abideth<a name="FNanchor_6_306" id="FNanchor_6_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_306" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> no
fairness of this Child, and on this Child dwelleth no foulness of
this body</i>.</p>

<p>It is more blissful that man be taken from pain, than
that pain be taken from man;<a name="FNanchor_7_307" id="FNanchor_7_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_307" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for if pain be taken from
us it may come again: therefore it is a sovereign comfort
and blissful beholding in a loving soul that we shall
be taken from pain. For in this behest<a name="FNanchor_8_308" id="FNanchor_8_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_308" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I saw a marvellous
compassion that our Lord hath in us for our woe,
and a courteous promising<a name="FNanchor_9_309" id="FNanchor_9_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_309" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of clear deliverance. For
He willeth that we be comforted in the overpassing;<a name="FNanchor_10_310" id="FNanchor_10_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_310" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and <i>that</i> He shewed in these words: <i>And thou shalt come
up above, and thou shalt have me to thy meed, and thou shalt be
fulfilled of joy and bliss</i>.</p>

<p>It is God's will that we set the point of our thought
in this blissful beholding as often as we may,&mdash;and as
long time keep us therein with His grace; for this is a
blessed contemplation to the soul that is led of God, and
full greatly to His worship, for the time that it lasteth.
And [when] we fall again to our heaviness, and spiritual
blindness, and feeling of pains spiritual and bodily, by
our frailty, it is God's will that we know that He hath
not forgotten us. And so signifieth He in these words:
<i>And thou shalt never more have pain; no manner of sickness,
no manner of misliking, no wanting of will; but ever joy and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<i>bliss without end. What should it then aggrieve thee to suffer
awhile, seeing it is my will and my worship?</i></p>

<p>It is God's will that we take His behests<a name="FNanchor_11_311" id="FNanchor_11_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_311" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and His
comfortings as largely and as mightily as we may take
them, and also He willeth that we take our abiding and

<p style="text-align:center">"The Charity of God maketh in us such a unity that, when
it is truly seen, no man can part himself from other"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And thus I understood that what man or woman with
firm will<a name="FNanchor_1_313" id="FNanchor_1_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_313" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> chooseth God in this life, for love, he
may be sure that he is loved without end: which endless
love worketh in him that grace. For He willeth that
we be as assured in hope of the bliss of heaven while we
are here, as we shall be in sureness while we are there.
And ever the more pleasance and joy that we take in
this sureness, with reverence and meekness, the better
pleaseth Him, as it was shewed. This reverence that I
mean is a holy courteous dread of our Lord, to which
meekness is united: and that is, that a creature seeth the
Lord marvellous great, and itself marvellous little. For
these virtues are had endlessly by the loved of God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
this may now be seen and felt in measure through the
gracious presence of our Lord when it is [seen]: which
presence in all things is most desired, for it worketh
marvellous assuredness in true faith, and sure hope,
by greatness of charity, in dread that is sweet and
delectable.</p>

<p>It is God's will that I see myself as much bound<a name="FNanchor_2_314" id="FNanchor_2_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_314" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to
Him in love as if He had done for me all that He hath
done; and thus should every soul think inwardly of its<a name="FNanchor_3_315" id="FNanchor_3_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_315" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Lover. That is to say, the Charity of God maketh in us
such a unity that, when it is truly seen, no man can part
himself from other. And thus ought our soul to think
that God hath done for it<a name="FNanchor_4_316" id="FNanchor_4_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_316" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> all that He hath done.</p>

<p>And this sheweth He to make us to love Him and
nought dread but Him. For it is His will that we perceive
that all the might of our Enemy is taken into our
Friend's hand; and therefore the soul that knoweth
assuredly this, he<a name="FNanchor_5_317" id="FNanchor_5_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_317" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> shall not dread but Him that he
loveth. All other dread he<a name="FNanchor_6_318" id="FNanchor_6_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_318" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> setteth among passions and
bodily sickness and imaginations. And therefore though
we be in so much pain, woe, and distress that it seemeth
to us we can think [of] right nought but [of] that
[which] we are in, or [of] that [which] we feel, [yet] as
soon as we may, pass we lightly over, and set we it at
nought. And why? For that God willeth we know
[Him]; and if we know Him and love Him and reverently
dread Him, we shall have peace, and be in great rest,
and it shall be great pleasance to us, all that He doeth.
And this shewed our Lord in these words: <i>What should
it then aggrieve thee to suffer awhile, sith it is my will and my
worship?</i></p>

feeling a little bodily pain I unwisely lost for the time the
comfort of all this blessed Shewing of our Lord God"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And after this the good Lord shewed the Sixteenth
[Revelation] on the night following, as I shall tell
after: which Sixteenth was conclusion and confirmation
to all Fifteen.</p>

<p>But first me behoveth to tell you as anent my feebleness,
wretchedness and blindness.&mdash;I have said in the
beginning: <i>And in this [moment] all my pain was suddenly
taken from me:</i> of which pain I had no grief nor distress
as long as the Fifteen Shewings lasted following. And
at the end all was close, and I saw no more. And soon
I felt that I should live and languish;<a name="FNanchor_1_319" id="FNanchor_1_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_319" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and anon my
sickness came again: first in my head with a sound and
a din, and suddenly all my body was fulfilled with sickness
like as it was afore. And I was as barren and as
dry as [if] I never had comfort but little. And as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
wretched creature I moaned and cried for feeling of my
bodily pains and for failing of comfort, spiritual and
bodily.</p>

<p>Then came a Religious person to me and asked me
how I fared. I said I had raved to-day. And he
laughed loud and heartily.<a name="FNanchor_2_320" id="FNanchor_2_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_320" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And I said: <i>The Cross that
stood afore my face, methought it bled fast</i>. And with this
word the person that I spake to waxed all sober and
marvelled. And anon I was sore ashamed and astonished
for my recklessness, and I thought: <i>This man taketh in
sober earnest<a name="FNanchor_3_321" id="FNanchor_3_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_321" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the least word that I might say</i>. Then said I
no more thereof. And when I saw that he took it
earnestly and with so great reverence, I wept, full
greatly ashamed, and would have been shriven; but at
that time I could tell it no priest, for I thought: <i>How
should a priest believe me? I believe not our Lord God.</i>
This [Shewing] I believed verily for the time that I saw
Him, and so was then my will and my meaning ever for
to do without end; but as a fool I let it pass from my
mind. Ah! lo, wretch that I am! this was a great sin,
great unkindness, that I for folly of feeling of a little
bodily pain, so unwisely lost for the time the comfort
of all this blessed Shewing of our Lord God. Here may
you see what I am of myself.</p>

<p>But herein would our Courteous Lord not leave me.
And I lay still till night, trusting in His mercy, and then
I began to sleep. And in the sleep, at the beginning,
methought the Fiend set him on my throat, putting forth
a visage full near my face, like a young man's and it was
long and wondrous lean: I saw never none such. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
colour was red like the tilestone when it is new-burnt,
with black spots therein like black freckles&mdash;fouler than
the tilestone. His hair was red as rust, clipped in front,<a name="FNanchor_4_322" id="FNanchor_4_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_322" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
with full locks hanging on the temples. He grinned on
me with a malicious semblance, shewing white teeth:
and so much methought it the more horrible. Body
nor hands had he none shapely, but with his paws he
held me in the throat, and would have strangled me,
but he might not.</p>

<p>This horrible Shewing was made [whilst I was]
sleeping, and so was none other. But in all this time
I trusted to be saved and kept by the mercy of God.
And our Courteous Lord gave me grace to waken; and
scarcely had I my life. The persons that were with me
looked on me, and wet my temples, and my heart began
to comfort. And anon a light smoke came in the door,
with a great heat and a foul stench. I said: <i>Benedicite
Domine! it is all on fire that is here!</i> And I weened it
had been a bodily fire that should have burnt us all to
death. I asked them that were with me if they felt any
stench. They said, Nay: they felt none. I said:
<i>Blessed be God!</i> For then wist I well it was the Fiend
that was come to tempest me. And anon I took to that
[which] our Lord had shewed me on the same day, with
all the Faith of Holy Church (for I beheld it is both
one), and fled thereto as to my comfort. And anon all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
vanished away, and I was brought to great rest and
peace, without sickness of body or dread of conscience.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"The place that Jesus taketh in our soul He shall never
remove from, without end:&mdash;for in us His homliest home and
His endless dwelling." "Our soul can never have rest in things
that are beneath itself&mdash;yet may it not abide in the beholding of
its self"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And then our Lord opened my spiritual eye and
shewed me my soul in midst of my heart. I saw
the Soul so large as it were an endless world, and as it
were a blissful kingdom. And by the conditions that I
saw therein I understood that it is a worshipful City.
In the midst of that City sitteth our Lord Jesus, God
and Man, a fair Person of large stature, highest Bishop,
most majestic<a name="FNanchor_1_323" id="FNanchor_1_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_323" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> King, most worshipful Lord; and I saw
Him clad majestically.<a name="FNanchor_2_324" id="FNanchor_2_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_324" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And worshipfully He sitteth in
the Soul, even-right<a name="FNanchor_3_325" id="FNanchor_3_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_325" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in peace and rest. And the Godhead
ruleth and sustaineth<a name="FNanchor_4_326" id="FNanchor_4_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_326" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> heaven and earth and all that
is,&mdash;sovereign Might, sovereign Wisdom, and sovereign
Goodness,&mdash;[but] the place that Jesus taketh in <i>our Soul</i>
He shall never remove it, without end, as to my sight:
for in us is His <i>homliest</i> home and His <i>endless</i> dwelling.<a name="FNanchor_5_327" id="FNanchor_5_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_327" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>And in this [sight] He shewed the satisfying that He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
hath of the making of Man's Soul. For as well as the
Father might make a creature, and as well as the Son
could make a creature, so well would the Holy Ghost
that Man's Soul were made: and so it was done. And
therefore the blessed Trinity enjoyeth without end in the
making of Man's Soul: for He saw from without beginning
what should please Him without end. All thing
that He hath made sheweth His Lordship,&mdash;as understanding
was given at the same time by example of a
creature that is to see great treasures and kingdoms
belonging to a lord; and when it had seen all the nobleness
beneath, then, marvelling, it was moved to seek
above to the high place where the lord dwelleth, knowing,
by reason, that his dwelling is in the worthiest place.
And thus I understood in verity that our Soul may never
have rest in things that are beneath itself. And when it
cometh above all creatures into the Self, yet may it not
abide in the beholding of its Self, but all the beholding is
blissfully set in God that is the Maker dwelling therein.
For in Man's Soul is His very dwelling; and the highest
light and the brightest shining of the City is the glorious
love of our Lord, as to my sight.</p>

<p>And what may make us more to enjoy in God than to
see in Him that He enjoyeth in the highest of all His
works? For I saw in the same Shewing that if the
blessed Trinity might have made Man's Soul any better,
any fairer, any nobler than it was made, He should not
have been full pleased with the making of Man's Soul.
And He willeth that our hearts be mightily raised above
the deepness of the earth and all vain sorrows, and rejoice<a name="FNanchor_6_328" id="FNanchor_6_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_328" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>

<p>This was a delectable Sight and a restful Shewing,
that it is so <i>without end</i>. The beholding of this

And all this teaching in this true comfort, it is

For I thought in sooth were I safe from sin, I were
full safe from all the fiends of hell and enemies of my
soul.</p>

<p>And thus he occupied me all that night, and on the
morn till it was about prime day. And anon they were
all gone, and all passed; and they left nothing but
stench, and that lasted still awhile; and I scorned him.</p>

<p>And thus was I delivered from him by the virtue of
Christ's Passion: for <i>therewith is the Fiend overcome</i>, as our
Lord Jesus Christ said afore.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"Above the Faith is no goodness kept in this life, as to my
sight, and beneath the Faith is no help of soul; but <i>in</i> the
Faith, <i>there</i> willeth the Lord that we keep us"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>In all this blessed Shewing our good Lord gave understanding
that the Sight should pass: which blessed
Shewing the Faith keepeth, with His own good will and
His grace. For He left with me neither sign nor token
whereby I might know it, but He left with me His
own blessed word in true understanding, bidding me full
mightily that I should believe it. And so I do,&mdash;Blessed
may He be!&mdash;I believe that He is our Saviour
that shewed it, and that it is the Faith that He shewed:
and therefore I believe it, rejoicing. And thereto I am
bounden by all His own meaning, with the next words
that follow: <i>Keep thee therein, and comfort thee therewith,
and trust thou thereto</i>.</p>

<p>Thus I am bounden to keep it in my faith. For on
the same day that it was shewed, what time that the
Sight was passed, as a wretch I forsook it, and openly I
said that I had raved. Then our Lord Jesus of His
mercy would not let it perish, but He showed it all
again <i>within in my soul</i><a name="FNanchor_1_335" id="FNanchor_1_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_335" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with more fulness, with the
blessed light of His precious love: saying these words
full mightily and full meekly: <i>Wit it now well: it was no
raving that thou sawest this day</i>. As if He had said: <i>For
that the Sight was passed from thee, thou losedst it and hadst</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<i>not skill to keep<a name="FNanchor_2_336" id="FNanchor_2_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_336" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it. But wit<a name="FNanchor_3_337" id="FNanchor_3_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_337" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> it now</i>; that is to say, <i>now
that thou seest it</i>. This was said not only for that same
time, but also to set thereupon the ground of my faith
when He saith anon following: <i>But take it, believe it, and
keep thee therein and comfort thee therewith and trust thou
thereto; and thou shalt not be overcome</i>.</p>

<p>In these six words that follow (<i>Take it</i>&mdash;[etc.]) His
meaning is to fasten it faithfully in our heart: for He
willeth that it dwell with us in faith to our life's end,
and after in fulness of joy, desiring that we have ever
steadfast trust in His blissful behest&mdash;knowing His
Goodness.</p>

<p>For our faith is contraried in diverse manners by our
own blindness, and our spiritual enemy, within and without;
and therefore our precious Lover helpeth us with
spiritual sight and true teaching in sundry manners within
and without, whereby that we may know Him. And
therefore in whatsoever manner He teacheth us, He
willeth that we perceive Him wisely, receive Him sweetly,
and keep us in Him faithfully. For above the Faith is
no goodness kept in this life, as to my sight, and beneath
the Faith is no help of soul; but in the Faith, there
willeth the Lord that we keep us. For we have by His
goodness and His own working to keep us in the Faith;
and by His sufferance through ghostly enmity we are
assayed in the Faith and made mighty. For if our faith
had none enmity, it should deserve no meed, according
to the understanding that I have in all our Lord's teaching.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"Three manners of looking seen in our Lord's Countenance"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Glad and joyous and sweet is the Blissful lovely
Cheer<a name="FNanchor_1_338" id="FNanchor_1_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_338" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of our Lord to our souls. For He
[be]holdeth<a name="FNanchor_2_339" id="FNanchor_2_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_339" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> us ever, living in love-longing: and He
willeth that <i>our</i> soul be in glad cheer to Him, to give
Him His meed. And thus, I hope, with His grace He
hath [drawn], and more shall draw, the Outer Cheer to
the Inner Cheer, and make us all one with Him, and
each of us with other, in true lasting joy that is Jesus.</p>

<p>I have signifying of Three manners of Cheer of our
Lord. The first is Cheer of Passion, as He shewed
while He was here in this life, dying. Though this
[manner of] Beholding be mournful and troubled, yet it
is glad and joyous: for He is God.&mdash;The second manner
of Cheer is [of] Ruth and Compassion: and this sheweth
He, with sureness of Keeping, to all His lovers that
betake them<a name="FNanchor_3_340" id="FNanchor_3_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_340" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to His mercy. The third is the Blissful
Cheer, as it shall be without end: and this was [shewed]
oftenest and longest-continued.</p>

<p>And thus in the time of our pain and our woe He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
sheweth us Cheer of His Passion and His Cross, helping
us to bear it by His own blessed virtue. And in the
time of our sinning He sheweth to us Cheer of Ruth
and Pity, mightily keeping us and defending us against all
our enemies. And these be the common Cheer which He
sheweth to us in this life; therewith mingling the third:
and that is His Blissful Cheer, like, in part, as it shall
be in Heaven. And that [shewing is] by gracious touching
and sweet lighting of the spiritual life, whereby that
we are kept in sure faith, hope, and charity, with contrition
and devotion, and also with contemplation and all
manner of true solace and sweet comforts.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"As long as we be meddling with any part of sin we shall never
see clearly the Blissful Countenance of our Lord"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>But now behoveth me to tell in what manner I saw
sin deadly in the creatures which shall not die for
sin, but live in the joy of God without end.</p>

<p>I saw that two contrary things should never be together
in one place. The most contrary that are, is the
highest bliss and the deepest pain. The highest bliss
that is, is to have Him in clarity of endless life, Him
verily seeing, Him sweetly feeling, all-perfectly having
in fulness of joy. And thus was the Blissful Cheer of
our Lord shewed in Pity:<a name="FNanchor_1_341" id="FNanchor_1_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_341" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in which Shewing I saw that
sin is most contrary,&mdash;so far forth that as long as we be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
meddling with any part of sin, we shall never see clearly
the Blissful Cheer of our Lord. And the more horrible
and grievous that our sins be, the deeper are we for that
time from this blissful sight. And therefore it seemeth
to us oftentimes as we were in peril of death, in a part
of hell, for the sorrow and pain that the sin is to us.
And thus we are dead for the time from the very sight
of our blissful life. But in all this I saw soothfastly that
we be not dead in the sight of God, nor He passeth
never from us. But He shall never have His full bliss
in us till we have our full bliss in Him, verily seeing His
fair Blissful Cheer. For we are ordained thereto in nature,
and get thereto by grace. Thus I saw how sin is deadly
for a short time in the blessed creatures of endless life.</p>

<p>And ever the more clearly that the soul seeth this
Blissful Cheer by grace of loving, the more it longeth to
see it in fulness. For notwithstanding that our Lord God
dwelleth in us and is here with us, and albeit He claspeth
us and encloseth<a name="FNanchor_2_342" id="FNanchor_2_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_342" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> us for tender love that He may never
leave<a name="FNanchor_3_343" id="FNanchor_3_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_343" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> us, and is more near to us than tongue can tell or
heart can think, yet may we never stint of moaning nor
of weeping nor of longing till when we see Him clearly
in His Blissful Countenance. For in that precious blissful
sight there may no woe abide, nor any weal fail.<a name="FNanchor_4_344" id="FNanchor_4_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_344" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>And in this I saw matter of mirth and matter of moaning:
matter of mirth: for our Lord, our Maker, is so
near to us, and in us, and we in Him, by sureness of
keeping through His great goodness; matter of moaning:
for our ghostly eye is so blind and we be so borne down
by weight of our mortal flesh and darkness of sin, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
we may not see our Lord God clearly in His fair Blissful
Cheer. No; and because of this dimness<a name="FNanchor_5_345" id="FNanchor_5_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_345" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> scarsely we
can believe and trust His great love and our sureness<a name="FNanchor_6_346" id="FNanchor_6_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_346" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of
keeping. And therefore it is that I say we may never
stint of moaning nor of weeping. This "weeping"
meaneth not all in pouring out of tears by our bodily
eye, but also hath more ghostly understanding. For
the kindly desire of our soul is so great and so unmeasurable,
that if there were given us for our solace
and for our comfort all the noble things that ever God
made in heaven and in earth, and we saw not the fair
Blissful Cheer<a name="FNanchor_7_347" id="FNanchor_7_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_347" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of Himself, yet we should not stint of
moaning nor ghostly weeping, that is to say, of painful
longing, till when we [should] see verily the fair Blissful
Cheer of our Maker. And if we were in all the pain
that heart can think and tongue may tell, if we might in
that time see His fair Blissful Cheer, all this pain should
not aggrieve us.</p>

<p>Thus is that Blissful Sight [the] end of all manner of
pain to the loving soul, and the fulfilling of all manner
of joy and bliss. And that shewed He in the high,
marvellous words where He said: <i>I it am that is highest;
I it am that is lowest; I it am that is all</i>.</p>

<p>It belongeth to us to have three manner of knowings:
the first is that we know our Lord God; the second is
that we know our self: what we are by Him, in Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and Grace; the third is that we know meekly what our
self is anent our sin and feebleness. And for these three
was all the Shewing made, as to mine understanding.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_LXXIII" id="CHAPTER_LXXIII">CHAPTER LXXIII</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"Two manners of sickness that we have: impatience, or
sloth;&mdash;despair, or mistrustful dread"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>All the blessed teaching of our Lord was shewed by
three parts: that is to say, by bodily sight, and by
word formed in mine understanding, and by spiritual
sight. For the bodily sight, I have said as I saw, as
truly as I can; and for the words, I have said them
right as our Lord shewed them to me; and for the
spiritual sight, I have told some deal, but I may never
fully tell it: and therefore of this sight I am stirred to
say more, as God will give me grace.</p>

<p>God shewed two manners of sickness that we have:
the one is impatience, or sloth: for we bear our travail
and our pains heavily; the other is despair, or doubtful
dread, which I shall speak of after. <i>Generally</i>, He
shewed <i>sin</i>, wherein that all is comprehended, but in
special He shewed only these two. And these two are
they that most do travail and tempest us, according to
that which our Lord shewed me; and of them He would
have us be amended. I speak of such men and women
as for God's love hate sin and dispose themselves to do
God's will: then by our spiritual blindness and bodily
heaviness we are most inclining to these. And therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it is God's will that they be known, for then we shall
refuse them as we do other sins.</p>

<p>And for help of this, full meekly our Lord shewed the
patience that He had in His Hard Passion; and also the
joying and the satisfying that He hath of that Passion,
for love. And this He shewed in example that we should
gladly and wisely bear our pains, for that is great pleasing
to Him and endless profit to us. And the cause why
we are travailed with them is for lack in knowing<a name="FNanchor_1_348" id="FNanchor_1_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_348" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of
Love. Though the three Persons in the Trinity<a name="FNanchor_2_349" id="FNanchor_2_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_349" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> be all
even<a name="FNanchor_3_350" id="FNanchor_3_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_350" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in Itself, the soul<a name="FNanchor_4_351" id="FNanchor_4_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_351" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> took most understanding in
Love; yea, and He willeth that in all things we have our
beholding and our enjoying in Love. And of this
knowing are we most blind. For some of us believe
that God is Almighty and may do all, and that He is
All-Wisdom and can do all; but that He is All-Love and
will do all, there we stop short.<a name="FNanchor_5_352" id="FNanchor_5_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_352" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And this not-knowing
it is, that hindereth most God's lovers, as to my sight.</p>

<p>For when we begin to hate sin, and amend us by the
ordinance of Holy Church, yet there dwelleth a dread
that letteth us, because of the beholding of our self and
of our sins afore done. And some of us because of our
every-daily sins: for we hold not our Covenants, nor
keep we our cleanness that our Lord setteth us in, but
fall oftentimes into so much wretchedness that shame
it is to see it. And the beholding of this maketh us so
sorry and so heavy, that scarsely we can find any comfort.</p>

<p>And this dread we take sometime for a meekness, but
it is a foul blindness and a weakness.<a name="FNanchor_6_353" id="FNanchor_6_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_353" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
despise it as we do another sin, that we know [as sin]: for
it cometh [subtly] of Enmity, and it is against truth. For
it is God's will that of all the properties of the blissful
Trinity, we should have most sureness and comfort in
Love: for Love maketh Might and Wisdom full meek to
us. For right as by the courtesy of God He forgiveth
our sin after the time that we repent us, right so willeth
He that <i>we</i> forgive our sin, as anent our unskilful
heaviness and our doubtful dreads.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_LXXIV" id="CHAPTER_LXXIV">CHAPTER LXXIV</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"There is no dread that fully pleaseth God in us but reverent
dread"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>For I understand [that there be] four manner of
dreads. One is the dread of an affright that
cometh to a man suddenly by frailty. This dread doeth
good, for it helpeth to purge man, as doeth bodily sickness
or such other pain as is not sin. For all such pains
help man if they be patiently taken. The second is
dread of pain, whereby man is stirred and wakened from
sleep of sin. He is not able for the time to perceive the
soft comfort of the Holy Ghost, till he have understanding
of this dread of pain, of bodily death, of spiritual
enemies; and this dread stirreth us to seek comfort and
mercy of God, and thus this dread helpeth us,<a name="FNanchor_1_354" id="FNanchor_1_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_354" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
enableth us to have contrition by the blissful touching
of the Holy Ghost. The third is doubtful dread. Doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
dread in as much as it draweth to despair, God will
have it turned in us into love by the knowing of love:
that is to say, that the bitterness of doubt be turned into
the sweetness of natural love by grace. For it may
never please our Lord that His servants doubt in His
Goodness. The fourth is reverent dread: for there is
no dread that fully pleaseth God in us but reverent
dread. And that is full soft, for the more it is had, the
less it is felt for sweetness of love.</p>

<p>Love and Dread are brethren, and they are rooted in
us by the Goodness of our Maker, and they shall never
be taken from us without end. We have of nature to
love and we have of grace to love: and we have of
nature to dread and we have of grace to dread. It
belongeth to the Lordship and to the Fatherhood to be
dreaded, as it belongeth to the Goodness to be loved:
and it belongeth to us that are His servants and His
children to dread Him for Lordship and Fatherhood, as
it belongeth to us to love Him for Goodness.</p>

<p>And though this reverent-dread and love be not parted
asunder, yet they are not both one, but they are two in
property and in working, and neither of them may be
had without other. Therefore I am sure, he that loveth,
he dreadeth, though that he feel it but a little.</p>

<p>All dreads other than reverent dread that are proffered
to us, though they come under the colour of holiness yet
are not so true, and hereby may they be known asunder.&mdash;That
dread that maketh us hastily to flee from all that is
not good and fall into our Lord's breast, as the Child into
the Mother's bosom,<a name="FNanchor_2_355" id="FNanchor_2_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_355" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with all our intent and with all our
mind, knowing our feebleness and our great need,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
knowing His everlasting goodness and His blissful love,
only seeking to Him for salvation, cleaving to [Him] with
sure trust: that dread that bringeth us into this working,
it is natural,<a name="FNanchor_3_356" id="FNanchor_3_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_356" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> gracious, good and true. And all that is
contrary to this, either it is wrong, or it is mingled with
wrong. Then is this the remedy, to know them both
and refuse the wrong.</p>

<p>For the natural property of dread which we have in
this life by the gracious working of the Holy Ghost, the
same shall be in heaven afore God, gentle, courteous,
and full delectable. And thus we shall in love be homely
and near to God, and we shall in dread be gentle and
courteous to God: and both alike equal.</p>

<p>Desire we of our Lord God to dread Him reverently,
to love Him meekly, to trust in Him mightily; for when
we dread Him reverently and love Him meekly our trust
is never in vain. For the more that we trust, and the
more mightily, the more we please and worship our
Lord that we trust in. And if we fail in this reverent
dread and meek love (as God forbid we should!), our
trust shall soon be misruled for the time. And therefore
it needeth us much to pray our Lord of grace that we
may have this reverent dread and meek love, of His gift,
in heart and in work. For without this, no man may
please God.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"We shall see verily the cause of all things that He hath done;
and evermore we shall see the cause of all things that He hath
permitted"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>I saw that God can do all that we need. And these
three that I shall speak of we need: love, longing,
pity. Pity in love keepeth us in the time of our need;
and longing in the same love draweth us up into
Heaven. For the Thirst of God is to have the general
Man unto Him: in which thirst He hath drawn His Holy
that be now in bliss; and getting His lively members,
ever He draweth and drinketh, and yet He thirsteth and
longeth.</p>

<p>I saw three manners of longing in God, and all to one
end; of which we have the same in us, and by the same
virtue and for the same end.</p>

<p>The first is, that He longeth to teach us to know Him
and love Him evermore, as it is convenient and speedful
to us. The second is, that He longeth to have us up to
His Bliss, as souls are when they are taken out of pain
into Heaven. The third is to fulfill us in bliss; and
that shall be on the Last Day, fulfilled ever to last.
For I saw, as it is known in our Faith, that the pain and
the sorrow shall be ended to all that shall be saved.
And not only we shall receive the same bliss that souls
afore have had in heaven, but also we shall receive a new
[bliss], which plenteously shall be flowing out of God
into us and shall fulfill us; and these be the goods which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
He hath ordained to give us from without beginning.
These goods are treasured and hid in Himself; for unto
that time [no] Creature is mighty nor worthy to receive
them.</p>

<p>In this [fulfilling] we shall see verily the cause
of all things that He hath done; and evermore we
shall see the cause of all things that He hath suffered.<a name="FNanchor_1_357" id="FNanchor_1_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_357" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
And the bliss and the fulfilling shall be so deep and
so high that, for wonder and marvel, all creatures shall
have to God so great reverent dread, overpassing
that which hath been seen and felt before, that the
pillars of heaven shall tremble and quake. But this
manner of trembling and dread shall have no pain; but
it belongeth to the worthy might of God thus to be
beholden by His creatures, in great dread trembling
and quaking for meekness of joy, marvelling at the
greatness of God the Maker and at the littleness of all
that is made. For the beholding of this maketh the
creature marvellously meek and mild.</p>

<p>Wherefore God willeth&mdash;and also it belongeth to us,
both in nature and grace&mdash;that we wit and know of this,
desiring this sight and this working; for it leadeth us in
right way, and keepeth us in true life, and oneth us to
God. And as good as God is, so great He is; and as
much as it belongeth to His goodness to be loved,
so much it belongeth to His greatness to be dreaded.
For this reverent dread is the fair courtesy that is in
Heaven afore God's face. And as much as He shall
then be known and loved overpassing that He is now, in
so much He shall be dreaded overpassing that He is now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Wherefore it behoveth needs to be that all Heaven and
earth shall tremble and quake when the pillars shall
tremble and quake.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"The soul that beholdeth the fair nature of our Lord Jesus,
it hateth no hell but sin"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>I speak but little of reverent dread, for I hope it
may be seen in this matter aforesaid. But well I
wot our Lord shewed me no souls but those that dread
Him. For well I wot the soul that truly taketh the
teaching of the Holy Ghost, it hateth more sin for vileness
and horribleness than it doth all the pain that is in hell.
For the soul that beholdeth the fair nature<a name="FNanchor_1_358" id="FNanchor_1_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_358" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of our Lord
Jesus, it hateth no hell but sin, as to my sight. And
therefore it is God's will that we know sin, and pray
busily and travail earnestly and seek teaching meekly
that we fall not blindly therein; and if we fall, that we
rise readily. For it is the most pain that the soul may
have, to turn from God any time by sin.</p>

<p>The soul that willeth to be in rest when [an] other
man's sin cometh to mind, he shall flee it as the pain of hell,
seeking unto God for remedy, for help against it. For
the beholding of other man's sins, it maketh as it were a
thick mist afore the eyes of the soul, and we cannot, for
the time, see the fairness of God, but if we may behold
them with contrition with him, with compassion on him,
and with holy desire to God for him. For without this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
it harmeth<a name="FNanchor_2_359" id="FNanchor_2_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_359" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and tempesteth and hindereth the soul that
beholdeth them. For this I understood in the Shewing
of Compassion.</p>

<p>In this blissful Shewing of our Lord I have understanding
of two contrary things: the one is the most
wisdom that any creature may do in this life, the other
is the most folly. The most wisdom is for a creature to
do after the will and counsel of his highest sovereign
Friend. This blessed Friend is Jesus, and it is His will
and His counsel that we hold us with Him, and fasten
us to Him homely&mdash;evermore, in what state soever that
we be; for whether-so that we be foul or clean, we are
all one in His loving. For weal nor for woe He willeth
never we flee from Him. But because of the changeability
that we are in, in our self, we fall often into sin.
Then we have this [doubting dread] by the stirring of
our enemy and by our own folly and blindness: for they
say thus: <i>Thou seest well thou art a wretched creature, a
sinner, and also unfaithful. For thou keepest not the Command<a name="FNanchor_3_360" id="FNanchor_3_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_360" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;
thou dost promise oftentimes our Lord that thou shalt
do better, and anon after, thou fallest again into the same,
especially into sloth and losing of time.</i> (For that is the
beginning of sin, as to my sight,&mdash;and especially to the
creatures that have given them to serve our Lord with
inward beholding of His blessed Goodness.) And this
maketh us adread to appear afore our courteous Lord.
Thus is it our enemy that would put us aback<a name="FNanchor_4_361" id="FNanchor_4_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_361" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with his
false dread, [by reason] of our wretchedness, through
pain that he threateth us with. For it is his meaning to
make us so heavy and so weary in this, that we should
let out of mind the fair, Blissful Beholding of our Everlasting
Friend.</p>

and thy woe is all thy fault." "All thy living is penance
profitable." "In the remedy He willeth that we rejoice"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Our good Lord shewed the enmity of the Fiend:
in which Shewing I understood that all that is
contrary to love and peace is of the Fiend and of his
part. And we have, of our feebleness and our folly, to
fall; and we have, of mercy and grace of the Holy
Ghost, to rise to more joy. And if our enemy aught
winneth of us by our falling, (for it is his pleasure,<a name="FNanchor_1_362" id="FNanchor_1_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_362" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) he
loseth manifold more in our rising by charity and meekness.
And this glorious rising, it is to him so great
sorrow and pain for the hate that he hath to our soul,
that he burneth continually in envy. And all this
sorrow that he would make us to have, it shall turn to
himself. And for this it was that our Lord scorned him,
and [it was] this [that] made me mightily to laugh.</p>

<p>Then is this the remedy, that we be aware of our
wretchedness and flee to our Lord: for ever the more
needy that we be, the more speedful it is to us to draw
nigh to Him.<a name="FNanchor_2_363" id="FNanchor_2_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_363" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And let us say thus in our thinking: <i>I know</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<i>well I have a shrewd pain; but our Lord is All-Mighty and
may punish me mightily; and He is All-Wisdom and can
punish me discerningly; and He is All-Goodness and loveth
me full tenderly</i>. And in this beholding it is necessary
for us to abide; for it is a lovely meekness of a sinful
soul, wrought by mercy and grace of the Holy Ghost,
when we willingly and gladly take the scourge and
chastening of our Lord that Himself will give us.
And it shall be full tender and full easy, if that we will
only hold us satisfied with Him and with all His works.</p>

<p>For the penance that man taketh of himself was not
shewed me: that is to say, it was not shewed specified.
But specially and highly and with full lovely manner of
look was it shewed that we shall meekly bear and suffer
the penance that God Himself giveth us, with mind in
His blessed Passion. (For when we have mind in His
blessed Passion, with pity and love, then we suffer with
Him like as His friends did that saw it. And this was
shewed in the Thirteenth Shewing, near the beginning,
where it speaketh of Pity.) For He saith: <i>Accuse not
[thy]self overdone much, deeming that thy tribulation and thy
woe is all for thy fault; for I will not that thou be heavy or
sorrowful indiscreetly. For I tell thee, howsoever thou do,
thou shalt have woe. And therefore I will that thou wisely
know thy penance; and [thou] shalt see in truth that all thy
living is penance profitable.</i></p>

<p>This place is prison and this life is penance, and in
the remedy He willeth that we rejoice. The remedy is
that our Lord is with us, keeping and leading into the
fulness of joy. For this is an endless joy to us in our
Lord's signifying, that He that shall be our bliss when
we are there, He is our keeper while we are here. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
way and our heaven is true love and sure trust; and of
this He gave understanding in all [the Shewings] and
especially in the Shewing of the Passion where He made
me mightily to choose Him for my heaven.<a name="FNanchor_3_364" id="FNanchor_3_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_364" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Flee we to our Lord and we shall be comforted, touch
we Him and we shall be made clean, cleave we to Him
and we shall be sure,<a name="FNanchor_4_365" id="FNanchor_4_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_365" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and safe from all manner of peril.</p>

<p>For our courteous Lord willeth that we should be as
homely with Him as heart may think or soul may desire.
But [let us] beware that we take not so recklessly this
homeliness as to leave courtesy. For our Lord Himself
is sovereign homeliness, and as homely as He is, so
courteous He is: for He is very courteous. And the
blessed creatures that shall be in heaven with Him without
end, He will have them like to Himself in all things.
And to be like our Lord perfectly, it is our very salvation
and our full bliss.</p>

<p>And if we wot not how we shall do all this, desire
we of our Lord and He shall teach us: for it is His own
good-pleasure and His worship; blessed may He be!</p>

special gift of our Lord, yet it is needful to us to have knowledge
and sight of our sin and our feebleness"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Our Lord of His mercy sheweth us our sin and our
feebleness by the sweet gracious light of Himself;
for our sin is so vile and so horrible that He of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
courtesy will not shew it to us but by the light of His
grace and mercy. Of four things therefore it is His will
that we have knowing: the first is, that He is our Ground
from whom we have all our life and our being. The
second is, that He keepeth us mightily and mercifully in
the time that we are in our sin and among all our enemies,
that are full fell upon us; and so much we are in the
more peril for [that] we give them occasion thereto, and
know not our own need.<a name="FNanchor_1_366" id="FNanchor_1_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_366" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The third is, how courteously
He keepeth us, and <i>maketh us to know</i> that we go amiss.
The fourth is, how steadfastly He abideth us and changeth
no regard:<a name="FNanchor_2_367" id="FNanchor_2_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_367" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for He willeth that we be turned [again],
and oned to Him in love as He is to us.</p>

<p>And thus by this gracious knowing we may see our
sin profitably without despair. For truly we need to
see it, and by the sight we shall be made ashamed of
our self and brought down as anent our pride and presumption;
for it behoveth us verily to see that of ourselves
we are right nought but sin and wretchedness.
And thus by the sight of the less that our Lord sheweth
us, the more is reckoned<a name="FNanchor_3_368" id="FNanchor_3_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_368" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which we see not. For He
of His courtesy measureth the sight to us; for it is so
vile and so horrible that we should not endure to see it
as it is. And by this meek knowing after this manner,
through contrition and grace we shall be broken from
all that is not our Lord. And then shall our blessed
Saviour perfectly heal us, and one us to Him.</p>

<p>This breaking and this healing our Lord meaneth for
the general Man. For he that is highest and nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with God, he may see himself sinful&mdash;and needeth to&mdash;with
me; and I that am the least and lowest that shall
be saved, I may be comforted with him that is highest:
so hath our Lord oned us in charity; [as] where He
shewed me that I should sin.<a name="FNanchor_4_369" id="FNanchor_4_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_369" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>And for joy that I had in beholding of Him I attended
not readily to that Shewing, and our courteous Lord
stopped there and would not further teach me till that
He gave me grace and will to attend. And hereby was I
learned that though we be highly lifted up into contemplation
by the special gift of our Lord, yet it is needful to
us therewith to have knowing and sight of our sin and
our feebleness. For without this knowing we may not
have true meekness, and without this [meekness] we may
not be saved.</p>

<p>And afterward, also, I saw that we may not have this
knowing from our self; nor from none of all our spiritual
enemies: for they will us not so great good. For if it
were by their will, we should not see it until our ending
day. Then be we greatly beholden<a name="FNanchor_5_370" id="FNanchor_5_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_370" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to God for that
He will Himself, for love, shew it to us in time of mercy

men's sin except it may be for comfort and help of my fellow-Christians"
(<a href="#CHAPTER_LXXVI">lxxvi.</a>)<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Also I had of this [Revelation] more understanding.
In that He shewed me that I should sin, I took it
nakedly to mine own singular person, for I was none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
otherwise shewed at that time. But by the high,
gracious comfort of our Lord that followed after, I saw
that His meaning was for the general Man: that is to
say, All-Man; which is sinful and shall be unto the last
day. Of which Man I am a member, as I hope, by the
mercy of God. For the blessed comfort that I saw, it
is large enough for us all. And here was I learned that
I should see mine own sin, and not other men's sins but if
it may be for comfort and help of mine even-Christians.</p>

<p>And also in this same Shewing where I saw that I
should sin, there was I learned to be in dread for unsureness
of myself. For I wot not how I shall fall, nor I
know not the measure nor the greatness of sin; for that
would I have wist, with dread, and thereto I had none
answer.</p>

<p>Also our courteous Lord in the same time He shewed
full surely and mightily the endlessness and the unchangeability
of His love; and, afterward, that by His
great goodness and His grace inwardly keeping, the
love of Him and our soul shall never be disparted in two,
without end.<a name="FNanchor_1_371" id="FNanchor_1_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_371" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>And thus in this dread I have matter of meekness that
saveth me from presumption, and in the blessed Shewing
of Love I have matter of true comfort and of joy that
saveth me from despair. All this homely Shewing of
our courteous Lord, it is a lovely lesson and a sweet,
gracious teaching of Himself in comforting of our soul.
For He willeth that we [should] know by the sweetness
and homely loving of Him, that all that we see or
feel, within or without, that is contrary to this is of the
enemy and not of God. And thus;&mdash;If we be stirred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
to be the more reckless of our living or of the keeping
of our hearts because that we have knowing of this
plenteous love, then need we greatly to beware. For
this stirring, if it come, is untrue; and greatly we ought
to hate it, for it all hath no likeness of God's will. And
when that we be fallen, by frailty or blindness, then our
courteous Lord toucheth us and stirreth us and calleth
us; and then willeth He that we see our wretchedness
and meekly be aware of it.<a name="FNanchor_2_372" id="FNanchor_2_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_372" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But He willeth not that
we abide thus, nor He willeth not that we busy us

we be wretched over our self;<a name="FNanchor_3_373" id="FNanchor_3_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_373" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but He willeth that we
hastily turn ourselves unto Him. For He standeth all
aloof and abideth us sorrowfully and mournfully till when

<p>By three things man standeth in this life; by which three
God is worshipped, and we be speeded,<a name="FNanchor_1_374" id="FNanchor_1_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_374" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> kept and
saved.</p>

<p>The first is, use of man's Reason natural; the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
is, common teaching of Holy Church; the third is, inward
gracious working of the Holy Ghost. And these
three be all of one God: God is the ground of our
natural reason; and God, the teaching of Holy Church;
and God is the Holy Ghost. And all be sundry gifts
to which He willeth that we have great regard, and
attend us thereto. For these work in us continually
all together; and these be great things. Of which
great things He willeth that we have knowing here as it
were in an A.B.C., that is to say, that we have a little
knowing; whereof we shall have fulness in Heaven.
And that is for to speed us.</p>

<p>We know in our Faith that God alone took our
nature, and none but He; and furthermore that Christ
alone did all the works that belong to our salvation, and
none but He; and right so He alone doeth now the last
end: that is to say, He dwelleth here with us, and ruleth
us and governeth us in this living, and bringeth us to
His bliss. And this shall He do as long as any soul is
in earth that shall come to heaven,&mdash;and so far forth
that if there were no such soul but one, He should be
withal alone till He had brought him up to His bliss.
I believe and understand the ministration of angels, as
clerks tell us: but it was not shewed me. For Himself
is nearest and meekest, highest and lowest, and doeth
all. And not only all that we need, but also He doeth
all that is worshipful, to our joy in heaven.</p>

<p>And where I say that He abideth sorrowfully and
moaning, it meaneth all the true feeling that <i>we</i> have
in our self, in contrition and compassion, and all sorrowing
and moaning that we are not oned with our Lord.
And all such that is speedful, it is Christ in us. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
though some of us feel it seldom, it passeth never from
Christ till what time He hath brought us out of all our
woe. For love suffereth never to be without pity. And
what time that we fall into sin and leave the mind of
Him and the keeping of our own soul, then keepeth
Christ alone all the charge; and thus standeth He sorrowfully
and moaning.</p>

<p>Then belongeth it to us for reverence and kindness to
turn us hastily to our Lord and leave Him not alone.
He is here alone with us all: that is to say, only for
us He is here. And what time I am strange to Him by
sin, despair or sloth, then I let my Lord stand alone, in
as much as it is in me. And thus it fareth with us all
which be sinners. But though it be so that we do thus
oftentimes, His Goodness suffereth us never to be alone,
but lastingly He is with us, and tenderly He excuseth
us, and ever shieldeth us from blame in His sight.</p>

<p>Our Good Lord shewed Himself in diverse manners
both in heaven and in earth, but I saw Him take
no place save in man's soul.</p>

<p>He shewed Himself in earth in the sweet Incarnation
and in His blessed Passion. And in other manner He
shewed Himself in earth [as in the Revelation] where I
say: <i>I saw God in a Point</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_375" id="FNanchor_1_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_375" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And in another manner He
shewed Himself in earth thus as it were in pilgrimage:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that is to say, He is here with us, leading us, and shall
be till when He hath brought us all to His bliss in
heaven. He shewed Himself diverse times reigning, as
it is aforesaid; but principally in man's soul. He hath
taken there His resting-place and His worshipful City:
out of which worshipful See He shall never rise nor
remove without end.</p>

<p>Marvellous and stately<a name="FNanchor_2_376" id="FNanchor_2_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_376" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is the place where the Lord

whole love than sorrowing in our often fallings. For it
is the most worship to Him of anything that we may do,
that we live gladly and merrily, for His love, in our
penance. For He beholdeth us so tenderly that He
seeth all our living [here] a penance: for nature's longing

to bear it. For His love maketh <i>Him</i> to long [for us];
His wisdom and His truth with His rightfulness maketh
<i>Him</i> to suffer us [to be] here: and in this same manner
[of longing and abiding] He willeth to see it in us. For
this is our natural penance,&mdash;and the highest, as to my
sight. For this penance goeth<a name="FNanchor_5_379" id="FNanchor_5_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_379" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> never from us till what
time that we be fulfilled, when we shall have Him to

<p style="text-align:center">"In falling and in rising we are ever preciously
kept in one Love"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>But here shewed our courteous Lord the moaning
and the mourning of the soul, signifying thus:
<i>I know well thou wilt live for my love, joyously and gladly
suffering all the penance that may come to thee; but in as much
as thou livest not without sin thou wouldest suffer, for my love,
all the woe, all the tribulation and distress that might come to
thee. And it is sooth.<a name="FNanchor_1_381" id="FNanchor_1_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_381" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But be not greatly aggrieved with
sin that falleth to thee against thy will.</i></p>

<p>And here I understood that [which was shewed] that
the Lord beholdeth the servant with pity and not with
blame.<a name="FNanchor_2_382" id="FNanchor_2_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_382" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For this passing life asketh<a name="FNanchor_3_383" id="FNanchor_3_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_383" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> not to live all
without blame and sin. He loveth us endlessly, and
we sin customably, and He sheweth us full mildly, and
then we sorrow and mourn discreetly, turning us unto
the beholding of His mercy, cleaving to His love and
goodness, seeing that He is our medicine, perceiving
that we do nought but sin. And thus by the meekness
we get by the sight of our sin, faithfully knowing His
everlasting love, Him thanking and praising, we please
Him:&mdash;<i>I love thee, and thou lovest me, and our love shall not
be disparted in two: for thy profit I suffer [these things to
come].</i> And all this was shewed in spiritual understanding,
saying these blessed words: <i>I keep thee full surely</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>And by the great desire that I saw in our blessed
Lord that we shall live in this manner,&mdash;that is to say,
in longing and enjoying, as all this lesson of love
sheweth,&mdash;thereby I understood that that which is contrarious
to us is not of Him but of enmity; and He
willeth that we know it by the sweet gracious light of
His kind love. If any such lover be in earth which is
continually kept from falling, I know it not: for it was
not shewed me. But this was shewed: that in falling
and in rising we are ever preciously kept in one Love.
For in the Beholding of God we fall not, and in the
beholding of self we stand not; and both these [manners
of beholding] be sooth as to my sight. But the Beholding
of our Lord God is the highest soothness.<a name="FNanchor_4_384" id="FNanchor_4_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_384" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Then are we greatly bound to God<a name="FNanchor_5_385" id="FNanchor_5_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_385" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> [for] that He
willeth in this living to shew us this high soothness.
And I understood that while we be in this life it is full
speedful to us that we see both these at once. For the
higher Beholding keepeth us in spiritual solace and true
enjoying in God; [and] that other that is the lower
Beholding keepeth us in dread and maketh us ashamed
of ourself. But our good Lord willeth ever that we
hold us much more in the Beholding of the higher, and
[yet] leave not the knowing of the lower, unto the time
that we be brought up above, where we shall have our
Lord Jesus unto our meed and be fulfilled of joy and
bliss without end.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"Life, Love, and Light"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>I had, in part, touching, sight, and feeling in three
properties of God, in which the strength and effect
of all the Revelation standeth: and they were seen in
every Shewing, and most properly in the Twelfth, where
it saith oftentimes: [<i>It is I.</i>] The properties are these:
Life, Love, and Light.<a name="FNanchor_1_386" id="FNanchor_1_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_386" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In life is marvellous homeliness,
and in love is gentle courtesy, and in light is endless
Nature-hood. These properties were in one Goodness:
unto which Goodness my Reason would be oned, and
cleave to it with all its might.</p>

<p>I beheld with reverent dread, and highly marvelling
in the sight and in the feeling of the sweet accord, that
our Reason is in God; understanding that it is the
highest gift that we have received; and it is grounded
in nature.</p>

<p>Our faith is a light by nature coming of our endless
Day, that is our Father, God. In which light our
Mother, Christ, and our good Lord, the Holy Ghost,
leadeth us in this passing life. This light is measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
discreetly, needfully standing to us in the night. The
light is cause of our life; the night is cause of our
pain and of all our woe: in which we earn meed and
thanks of God. For we, with mercy and grace, steadfastly
know and believe our light, going therein wisely
and mightily.</p>

<p>And at the end of woe, suddenly our eyes shall be
opened, and in clearness of light our sight shall be full:
which light is God, our Maker and Holy Ghost, in
Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>

<p>Thus I saw and understood that our faith is our light
in our night: which light is God, our endless Day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_386" id="Footnote_1_386"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_386"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>Cf.</i> chs. <a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXV">lxxxv.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_LXXXVI">lxxxvi.</a> These words might be (as Life, Light,
and Love) for the Trinity of <i>Might</i> ("the Father willeth"), <i>Wisdom</i>
("the Son worketh"), <i>Love</i> ("the Holy Ghost confirmeth"): <i>one
Goodness</i>: or as it is sometimes denoted, the Trinity of <i>Might, Wisdom,
Goodness: one Love</i>. But here the thought seems to be centred in <i>Light</i>
as the manifestation of Being (of <i>Kyndhede</i> = relationships, correspondences
of nature): of the Triune Divine Light which in Man is corresponding
Reason, Faith, Charity: Charity keeping man, while here,
in Faith and Hope; Charity leading him from and through and into
the Eternal Divine Love.</p></div>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXIV" id="CHAPTER_LXXXIV">CHAPTER LXXXIV</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"Charity"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>The light is Charity, and the measuring of this light is
done to us profitably by the wisdom of God. For
neither is the light so large that we may see our blissful
Day, nor is it shut from us; but it is such a light in
which we may live meedfully, with travail deserving<a name="FNanchor_1_387" id="FNanchor_1_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_387" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the endless worship of God. And this was seen in the
Sixth Shewing where He said: <i>I thank thee of thy service
and of thy travail</i>. Thus Charity keepeth us in Faith and
Hope, and Hope leadeth us in Charity. And in the end
all shall be Charity.</p>

<p>I had three manners of understanding of this light,
Charity. The first is Charity unmade; the second is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Charity made; the third is Charity given. Charity
unmade is God; Charity made is our soul in God;
Charity given is virtue. And that is a precious gift of
working in which we love God, for Himself; and ourselves,
in God; and that which God loveth, for God.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">"Lord, blessed mayest Thou be, for it is thus: it is well"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>And in this sight I marvelled highly. For notwithstanding
our simple living and our blindness here,
yet endlessly our courteous Lord beholdeth us in this
working, rejoicing; and of all things, we may please
Him best wisely and truly to believe, and to enjoy
with Him and in Him. For as verily as we shall
be in the bliss of God without end, Him praising
and thanking, so verily we have been in the
foresight of God, loved and known in His endless
purpose from without beginning. In which unbegun
love He made us; and in the same love He keepeth us
and never suffereth us to be hurt [in manner] by which
our bliss might be lost. And therefore when the Doom
is given and we be all brought up above, then shall we
clearly see in God the secret things which be now hid
to us. Then shall none of us be stirred to say in any
wise: <i>Lord, if it had been thus, then it had been full well</i>;
but we shall say all with one voice: <i>Lord, blessed mayst
thou be, for it is thus: it is well; and now see we verily that
all-thing is done as it was then ordained before that anything
was made.</i></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXVI" id="CHAPTER_LXXXVI">CHAPTER LXXXVI</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center">"Love was our Lord's Meaning"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>This book is begun by God's gift and His grace, but
it is not yet performed, as to my sight.</p>

<p>For Charity pray we all; [together] with <i>God's</i> working,
thanking, trusting, enjoying. For thus will our
good Lord be prayed to, as by the understanding that I
took of all His own meaning and of the sweet words
where He saith full merrily: <i>I am the Ground of thy
beseeching</i>. For truly I saw and understood in our Lord's
meaning that He shewed it for that He willeth to have
it known more than it is: in which knowing He will
give us grace to love to Him and cleave to Him. For
He beholdeth His heavenly treasure with so great love
on earth that He willeth to give us more light and solace
in heavenly joy, in drawing to Him of our hearts, for
sorrow and darkness<a name="FNanchor_1_388" id="FNanchor_1_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_388" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which we are in.</p>

<p>And from that time that it was shewed I desired
oftentimes to learn<a name="FNanchor_2_389" id="FNanchor_2_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_389" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> what was our Lord's meaning.
And fifteen years after, and more, I was answered in
ghostly understanding, saying thus: <i>Wouldst thou learn<a name="FNanchor_3_390" id="FNanchor_3_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_390" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> thy
Lord's meaning in this thing? Learn it well: Love was
His meaning. Who shewed it thee? Love. What shewed
He thee? Love. Wherefore shewed it He? For Love.
Hold thee therein and thou shalt learn and know more in the
same. But thou shalt never know nor learn therein other
thing without end.</i> Thus was I learned<a name="FNanchor_4_391" id="FNanchor_4_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_391" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that Love was
our Lord's meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>And I saw full surely that ere God made us He loved
us; which love was never slacked, nor ever shall be.
And in this love He hath done all His works; and
in this love He hath made all things profitable to
us; and in this love our life is everlasting. In our
making we had beginning; but the love wherein He
made us was in Him from without beginning: in which
love we have our beginning. And all this shall we see
in God, without end.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
